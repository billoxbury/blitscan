In this study, the consequences of afforestation of upland habitats for two distinct animal groups, birds and small mammals, were examined by comparing open moorland, early pre-thicket conifer forests (2–4 years post-replanting) and late pre-thicket conifer forests (6–8 years post-replanting) across 24 upland study sites in Ireland. Field data were collected using bird point counts, live trapping of small mammals and detailed vegetation surveys. A total of 17 bird species and four small mammal species were detected. Both groups showed contrasting patterns of abundance between moorland and pre-thicket forests, with bird density being higher in moorland, while small mammal abundance was higher in pre-thicket forests. Bird diversity was lowest in moorland and highest in late pre-thicket forests, while small mammal diversity was highest in moorland and lowest in late pre-thicket forests. Our study shows that afforestation can alter the abundance and community composition of bird and small mammal populations and that the consequences of land-use change associated with afforestation in upland areas vary across different taxa.

Individual woodpecker species were observed to quantify their foraging niche preferences. We found that forest sites with higher woodpecker richness were also rich in all other bird species. Further, the richness and abundance of woodpeckers and all other birds were affected by similar habitat variables. Four out of the eight woodpecker species occurring in the study area were found to fit our habitat models suitably, with canopy cover, tree density, and forest proportion proving to be important variables. Behavioural observations showed that the same four woodpecker species significantly preferred larger and taller trees for foraging.

Recent winter field surveys to estimate the species’ population size were almost totally conducted in coastal areas, but tracking studies showed that some individuals now winter inland. To ensure its long-term survival, we need a more comprehensive assessment of the current distribution and abundance of the species. We combined the most recent count data and satellite tracking information to update existing information about the population abundance and distribution of the Black-faced Spoonbill at all stages of its annual life cycle, and how these have changed during 2004–2020. Black-faced Spoonbills mainly breed on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, while immature birds show a wider summer distribution throughout Yellow Sea coastal areas, when a few remain on wintering sites in the south. Combined tracking results and mid-winter counts confirmed known wintering sites on the east and south coasts of China, but showed that the species also winters on wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain and in Southeast Asia. During 2004–2020, counts of wintering birds in coastal habitats increased from 1198 to 4864, with numbers wintering on the island of Taiwan contributing most to the overall increase. Latest counts found 5222 in 2021. We also identify key wintering and stopover sites as well as their current conservation status. This study revised the known summering and wintering ranges of the Black-faced Spoonbill and assessed the conservation status of key sites based on a combination of field survey and satellite tracking data. We recommend prioritisation of further field research to identify and survey inland wintering areas in the Yangtze River floodplain and summering areas of immature birds. More tracking of adult individuals and birds during spring migration is necessary to fill these information gaps.

Formulating effective conservation strategies therefore requires a better understanding of how the ranges of the world’s species have changed in the past, and how they will change under alternative future scenarios. Here, we use reconstructions of global land use and biomes since 1700, and 16 possible climatic and socio-economic scenarios until the year 2100, to map the habitat ranges of 16,919 mammal, bird, and amphibian species through time. We estimate that species have lost an average of 18% of their natural habitat range sizes thus far, and may lose up to 23% by 2100. Our data reveal that range losses have been increasing disproportionately in relation to the area of destroyed habitat, driven by a long-term increase of land use in tropical biodiversity hotspots. The outcomes of different future climate and land use trajectories for global habitat ranges vary drastically, providing important quantitative evidence for conservation planners and policy makers of the costs and benefits of alternative pathways for the future of global biodiversity. Long-term dynamics of species’ range sizes play a crucial role in determining extinction risks.

Some arctic-nesting shorebirds nest almost exclusively in areas where predation pressure is regularly released. The few species that can breed within the entire distribution range of the Arctic Fox, the main nest predator in the arctic tundra, are supposedly less sensitive to predation. However, empirical data supporting this hypothesis are scarce and mechanisms driving interspecific variation in vulnerability to nest predation are poorly documented. We monitored nest success of two arctic-nesting shorebirds with contrasting breeding distribution and nesting habitat. We found that (i) when co-existing at the same breeding site, the widely distributed Ringed Plovers nesting along stony shores showed a higher nest survival rate than the Golden Plovers nesting in mesic tundra, and (ii) such differences in nest survival were at least partly driven by the nesting habitat type per se, with lower predation risk in stony shores than in adjacent mesic tundra.

The white stork is among bird species that clearly profit from feeding at landfills, at least in Western Europe and North Africa. However, the rate and the consequences of this feeding are still unknown in the Central-Eastern European population, which differs from the western population not only in terms of migration routes but also in the greater availability of suitable natural breeding habitats due to less intensified agriculture. The aim of the study was to describe the use of landfills and its consequences in terms of probability of nest occupation and breeding effects in different regions of Poland. Although the most important factors influencing nest-site selection and breeding effect are still habitat quality and weather conditions, distance to landfills is important in selection of nest sites.

The species was described in 2014 and listed as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List, however, full assessment of the population was lacking. Using a combination of field observations, roost surveys and community questionnaires, conducted over the last 20 years, we provide up-to-date information on the species’ Extent of Occurrence, estimate its global population size, and evaluate its level of threat. Our results suggest the species occurs across an area of 19,890 km2 in three distinct geographically isolated subpopulations. Roost surveys across the range estimate the minimum remaining population at 741–1,090 individuals and we present evidence to suggest a 60% decline over the past 19 years in one part of the species’ range. We conducted community questionnaires with 427 people from 52 communities. The presence of pet parrots was reported in 37 communities, including 17 communities which reported pet A. lilacina. From this we predict that over half of all communities within our study area keep parrots as pets and at least 96 communities keep A. lilacina. Our findings justify an IUCN Red Listing of at least ‘Endangered’ for this species and highlight the need for conservation support. In order to assess population health in more detail, further research is required to assess genetic diversity and roost dynamics, and to identify areas that may be important for feeding and nesting throughout the range. As many of these areas are likely to overlap with community owned land, we suggest that future conservation actions should revolve around, and be led by, these communities.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0F375BC4D52F2EC20947D0520F2D03EA/S0959270920000222a.pdf/div-class-title-conservation-status-of-the-recently-described-ecuadorian-amazon-parrot-span-class-italic-amazona-lilacina-span-div.pdf,cambridge.org,guayaquil,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.24625316912486,['amazona lilacina'],688

In the parrots (Order Psittaciformes) these life history characteristics have combined with habitat loss and capture for the pet trade to lead to widespread endangerment, with over 40% of species classified under some level of threat. Here we report the results of a population survey of one such species, the Yellow-naped Amazon, Amazona auropalliata, that is classified as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List. We conducted a comprehensive survey in June and July of 2016 of 44 night roosts of the populations in contiguous Pacific lowlands of northern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua and compared numbers in Costa Rica to those found in a similar survey conducted in June 2005. In 2016 we counted 990 birds across 25 sites surveyed in Costa Rica and 692 birds across 19 sites surveyed in Nicaragua for a total population estimate of only 1,682 birds. Comparisons of 13 sites surveyed in both 2005 and 2016 in Costa Rica showed a strong and statistically significant decline in population numbers over the 11-year period. Assessment of group sizes approaching or leaving roosts indicated that less than 25% of groups consisted of three or more birds; there was a significantly higher proportion of these putative family groups observed in Nicaragua than Costa Rica. Taken together, these results are cause for substantial concern for the health of this species in a region that has previously been considered its stronghold, and suggest that stronger conservation action should be undertaken to protect remaining populations from capture for the pet trade and loss of key habitat.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A683CC55FE9F7307439A0592E16DD5BF/S0959270918000114a.pdf/div-class-title-yellow-naped-amazon-span-class-italic-amazona-auropalliata-span-populations-are-markedly-low-and-rapidly-declining-in-costa-rica-and-nicaragua-div.pdf,cambridge.org,yellownape,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-5.25198413748284,['amazona auropalliata'],1054

As top predators, raptors provide critical top-down ecosystem services and structure food webs. Yet, many avian predators are currently experiencing global population declines and some are threatened with extinction. The dire conservation status of numerous raptor species warrants urgent action, and detailed ecological data are needed to guide management strategy, including empirical knowledge regarding genetic structure. To that end, we compiled published studies investigating population genetic structure in raptors. Out of a total of 83 publications on 50 raptors species published, we identified a lack of empirical genetic studies for species from the Southern Hemisphere and species with a high level of extinction risk according to IUCN Red List criteria. Only 24% of the species studied are considered “threatened” (i.e., with the “Vulnerable”, “Endangered”, or “Critically Endangered” status). We found a significant signal of genetic differentiation in 41 species (82%) at the study-specific population. Isolation-by-Distance is a common pattern of genetic differentiation in raptors. Future steps in raptor conservation could prioritize facilitating genetic studies on species located in the Southern Hemisphere and on species with a conservation status.

Survival, especially of males, was lower when the population was large, but only in drier years. Survival declined with age but there was no evidence that this decline was other than linear.

We compared the avian community structure and abundance of certain species before and after the fire on the 18 permanent transects located in both burned and unburned habitats. Within first breeding season post fire, fire significantly reduced pooled abundance and species richness of the whole bird community. Three bird species of special conservation concern (including aquatic warbler) temporarily disappeared from burned areas, and the numbers of 11 other species declined. In contrast, only 3 species benefited from the fire, none of which depended on marshes as their primary habitat. Although the reported strong initial fire effect is likely to fade away in subsequent years, its immediate detrimental effects on marshland birds should not be underestimated. We conclude that it is essential to temporarily provide the unburned adjacent refuge areas with additional protection and bird-friendly management and to focus on preventing further degradation of marshes to increase their resilience to fire.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-022-02376-y.pdf,link.springer.com,grasshopper-warbler,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.3647384476957,['aquatic warbler'],63

However, there is little information on the avifauna associated with these forests in the Central Andes of Peru. We evaluated 12 bird communities in the Junín, Lima and Huancavelica departments of Peru and recorded richness-abundance data that were used to perform an analysis of α- and γ-diversity using Hill numbers. In addition, we built two species matrices (presence-absence data) for three previously identified key bird conservation areas and our study area, first with the species that regularly inhabit the Polylepis forests and second with the species of conservation interest. We found that the Polylepis forests of the Central Andes of Peru have a high diversity of birds. Some of these birds have a strong affinity for Polylepis forests, and another group is typical of the tree line of the Yungas. Moreover, we identified a unique set of 27 species of conservation interest in this region.

However, studies which have removed nest predators and monitored the response of prey populations have found mixed results. One explanation for this ambiguity is that, within species, predators differ in how likely they are to predate nests and only the removal of particularly predatory individuals will improve the breeding success of prey populations. Predators could differ in the extent to which they take nests due to variation in the local environment and/or variation within the predator population, e.g. differences in breeding status. Additional to these broad factors, certain individuals may specialise on particular prey. We placed 460 artificial nests in a systematically balanced design in UK farmland to analyse these sources of variation in predation. Magpies (Pica pica) were the most common predators of our artificial nests and the vulnerability of our nests to magpie predation varied according to magpie breeding status (predation was higher inside breeding magpies’ territories), but this effect varied temporally. More nests were predated inside of magpie territories late in the season, when magpies had dependent fledglings. More specifically, some nest locations were especially vulnerable independent of both magpie breeding status and time in breeding season. These nests may have been disproportionately predated by specific, particularly predatory, territorial magpies. Habitat management and/or predator removal may benefit songbird populations if targeted towards reducing the effect of particular individuals identified as more likely to predate songbird nests.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10344-019-1290-6.pdf,link.springer.com,neergaard,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.40076709215721,"['magpie', 'pica pica']",1060

Among these is the endangered Visayan Hornbill (Penelopides panini), found on the islands of Panay and Negros. Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, its population size is thought to have declined from 1800 individuals 20 years ago to less than 1000. However, a recent study on Negros estimated 3564 individuals across three core forest blocks. This study aims to quantify the Visayan Hornbill population size in and around the Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park (NWPPNP) on Panay, the largest contiguous low-elevation forest landscape remaining across its range, and its broad habitat associations across a gradient of environmental degradation. Hornbills were surveyed using 10-min distance sampling point counts (n = 367) along transects (average length 1.1 km). Environmental variables were recorded along transects, while habitat was classified into primary forest, secondary forest, plantation, or open habitat. Distance software was used to estimate population densities stratified by habitat, with the overall population estimate taken as a mean of habitat density estimates weighted by habitat area. Using generalized linear mixed models, hornbill occurrence was modelled using combinations of nine environmental variables as main and two-way fixed effects. Surveys covered 204.4 km2 of the 374.8 km2 Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbills were not recorded in plantations or open habitats. Hornbill density was significantly higher in primary forest (17.8 individuals/km2 ± 26.9% CV) than in secondary forest (3.7 individuals/km2 ± 33.2% CV; z = 15.212, P < 0.001). The overall population estimate for the NWPPNP and environs is 2109 individuals, and 2673 individuals for the entire Northwest Panay Peninsula. Hornbill presence was best explained by a model including distance from the Park boundary alongside five interaction effects and transect as a random effect. Distance, and the interaction between distance and medium-sized trees were significant predictors of hornbill presence.

While this relationship is likely due to greater extent of undisturbed habitats in larger lakes, we understand little of the drivers affecting individual behaviours behind this tendency. We tracked wintering movements of three duck species (Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Falcated Duck M. falcata and Northern Pintail Anas acuta) using GPS transmitters, examining differences between the two largest lakes and other smaller lakes in ducks’ habitat use, duration of stay at each lake and the daily distances moved by the tagged birds while at these sites. The Eurasian Wigeon and Falcated Duck stayed five times longer and almost exclusively used natural habitat types at the two large lakes (91‒95% of positions) compared to length of stay time at smaller lakes, where they spent 28‒33 days on average (excluding the capture site) and exploited many more different habitats (including c. 50% outside lakes). Our study is the first to show that shorter length of stay and more varied habitat use by ducks at small lakes may contribute to explaining the apparent regional concentration of numbers present of these and other species at the largest lakes in recent years.

Short-eared Owl experts also highlighted lack of knowledge and difficulties associated with monitoring as a major conservation challenge.

Natural habitats were more important than human-related habitats, except for the wooded pastures used for low-scale grazing, which are among the most important coverages. This habitat represented a good example of sustainable land use. In contrast, the croplands and touristic beach were notoriously unsustainable in terms of wildlife conservation. Among the natural habitats, the most important was the marshes that presented the higher richness, abundance, importance for the landscape network, and was the most used by birds of conservation concern.

Previous estimates of Areas of Habitat were constrained within the published ranges and thus were, by definition, smaller—typically about 30%. This reflects how little habitat within suitable elevation ranges exists within the published ranges. Our results show that on average, Areas of Habitat are 12% larger than published ranges, reflecting the often-considerable extent that eBird records expand the known distributions of species. Interestingly, there are substantial differences between threatened and non-threatened species. Some 40% of Critically Endangered, 43% of Endangered, and 55% of Vulnerable species have Areas of Habitat larger than their published ranges, compared with 31% for Near Threatened and Least Concern species.

Altogether, these results state that more conservation emphasis should be given to ecological rarity given future environmental conditions and the need to sustain multiple ecosystem processes in the long-term. There are many available ways to rank species for conservation prioritization.

Analysis of its status, distribution and the potential causes for the decline in Europe has been undertaken, but there has never been a review of its status in the major part of its breeding range across Russia to the Pacific coast. We reviewed the scientific literature and unpublished reports, and canvassed expert opinion throughout Russia to assess available knowledge about changes in the species distribution and abundance since the 1980s. While accepting available information may not be representative throughout the entire eastern range of the species, the review found marked declines in Pochard breeding abundance in the last two decades throughout European Russia. Pochard have also declined throughout Siberia. Declines throughout the steppe region seemed related to local drought severity in recent years, necessitating further research to confirm this climate link at larger spatial scales. Declines in the forest and forest-steppe regions appeared related to the major abandonment of fish farms in western Russia that had formerly provided habitat for breeding Pochard. However, hyper-eutrophication of shallow eutrophic lakes, cessation of grazing and haymaking in floodplain systems necessary to maintain suitable nesting habitat and disappearance of colonies of the Black-headed Gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) in a number of wetlands were also implicated. Increasing invasive alien predator species (e.g. American Mink Neovison vison and Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides) and increasing spring hunting were also thought to contribute to declines. Reports of expansion in numbers and range only came from small numbers occurring in the Russian Far East, including on the border with China and the long-established isolated population on Kamchatka Peninsula. Widespread declines throughout the eastern breeding range of the Pochard give continued cause for concern. Although we could address all the potential causal factors identified above by management interventions, we urgently need better information relating to key factors affecting site-specific Pochard breeding success and abundance, to be able to implement effective actions to restore the species to more favourable conservation status throughout its breeding range.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00209-6,avianres.biomedcentral.com,pochard,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-5.47934134249357,"['chroicocephalus ridibundus', 'pochard', 'aythya ferina', 'common pochard']",645

Information on factors hypothesised to influence spatial variation in the availability of impact data were collated for 60 regions with actual, recorded alien bird impacts, and 187 regions without. These data were analysed using mixed effects models. The characteristics of alien bird invasions most strongly influence the availability of impact data, which are more likely to be available for regions with higher alien bird species richness and longer alien bird residence times. There are many regions of the world that lack impact data but are characterised by high alien bird species richness and long alien bird residence times: it is likely that the impacts of alien birds are going unnoticed within them. To a lesser extent, impact data are also more likely to be available for regions characterised by higher economic development. Improving the capacity for research amongst less developed regions may therefore be a key strategy to improve our understanding of the impacts of alien birds.

There are numerous local and international long-term waterbird monitoring programmes with substantial variation in how frequently surveys are conducted. We aimed to assess how temporal frequency of waterbird surveys influence three aspects of population trends: (1) level of uncertainty around estimates of long-term trends; (2) frequency, duration and overlap of significant short-term increases or declines in trend trajectory; and (3) differences between estimated change in population size measured over four different time periods. Data from 28 years of surveys at a waste water treatment facility in South Africa were used to model the population trend of 41 waterbird species. We used generalised additive mixed-models to compare significance and magnitude of population change trends between monthly and biannual surveys. Direction and shape of species trends were similar between protocols although uncertainty around trends was generally lower when monthly data were used. The number of significant trend trajectories, the majority of which were declines, was higher in monthly models. Temporal overlap of periods of significant change of trends of the two protocols averaged 30%. However, both sampling protocols offered similar conclusions about long-term change in population size of species. General patterns differed conspicuously among species, although groups of species showed similar trajectories of population change. We conclude that biannual surveys are appropriate if the goal is to assess general patterns of population change. However, if management action relies on understanding the significance of population trajectories, surveys at a finer temporal scale are required, especially for species showing a pattern of unpredictable movement. Trade-offs between logistical constraints and statistical rigour as well as species identity need to be carefully considered for the design of long-term monitoring programmes of waterbirds.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-019-01828-2.pdf,link.springer.com,maccoa,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-5.49788600131205,,993

We investigated if research activities affected nest predation rate by analyzing the relationships of the daily nest survival rate with the research activities at the egg and nestling stages of a domed-nest species, the Silver-throated Tit (Aegithalos glaucogularis). Our results showed that nest daily survival rate was significantly affected by the laying date and nest age during the egg stage, and by the hatching date only during the nestling stage. By contrast, there were no significant effects of research activities, in terms of visiting nests and filming nests, on the nest survival of the Silver-throated Tit at both the egg and nestling stages.

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur. This finding could help to inform the development of the post-2020 biodiversity framework, by highlighting the under-studied regions where biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest. Analysing responses of biodiversity to changes in land use and climate across global ecoregions, the authors identify strong negative responses in both tropical and Mediterranean biomes, driven primarily by low climatic seasonality and the history of human disturbance.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01303-0.pdf,nature.com,philippa,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-5.4985222511132,,583

Yet few studies have examined changes over time in the elevational distribution of species along fragmented gradients in response to global warming. Here, we report on a resurvey of an understory bird community in the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, along a forested elevational gradient that has been fragmented over the last 200 years. In 2019, we resurveyed seven sites, ranging in elevation from 360 m to 2110 m, that were originally surveyed between 1979 and 1981. We calculated differences in mean elevation and lower and upper range limits for 29 species between the two time periods and corrected for possible differences in elevation due to chance. Over four decades, we documented a significant mean upslope shift across species of 93 m. This shift was smaller than the 125 m expected shift due to local climate warming. Of the 29 focal species, 19 shifted upslope, eight downslope, and two remained unchanged. Mean upslope shifts in species were driven largely by contracting lower range limits which moved significantly upslope on average across species by 183 m, while upper range limits shifted non-significantly upslope by 72 m, leading to a mean range contraction of 114 m across species. Community composition of understory bird species also shifted over time, with current communities resembling communities found historically at lower elevations. Past forest fragmentation in combination with the limited gap-crossing ability of many tropical understory bird species are very likely important contributory factors to the observed asymmetrical shifts in lower and upper elevational range limits. Re-establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains are critical to permitting species to shift upslope and to reduce further elevational range contractions over time.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248712&type=printable,journals.plos.org,dapple-throat,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-5.50124066401507,,386

We compared ecological traits between these species and all other 490 European bird species, which were not recorded as feeding from a human hand. We found that species with a large number of innovative behaviours, a higher rate of introduction success, larger breeding range, larger population size, and urban tolerance have a higher probability of feeding from the hand of a human. These associations were also supported after control for the similarity among taxa due to common phylogenetic descent.

This study investigated land use changes around Sihwa Lake (Republic of Korea) and evaluated the effect of these changes on waterbird community characteristics. We conducted a land-use-change analysis at the medium-resolution level using land cover maps for 2001, 2007, 2009, and 2014.

Wetland area decreased more than 10% while agricultural land, barren land, and grassland area increased more than 10% due to continuous reclamation activities around Sihwa Lake. Barren land later turned into agricultural land or other land use. Sixty-three species and 566,623 individuals were recorded. The number of species, population size, and species diversity index by year and by species showed decreasing trends that were more marked in spring and summer. Furthermore, seasonal and annual variations in waterbird species composition showed decreasing trends in dabbling ducks, herons, grebes, and shorebirds but diving ducks displayed increasing trends. In particular, shorebirds were reduced to a greater extent than other waterbird species because of the reduction and simplification of the intertidal zone, and shallow waters caused by reclamation and road construction. Increased development and construction around Sihwa Lake has altered migratory shorebird populations with a general decline in species diversity and population size.

The initial hypothesis, that the population would recover once the main threat, black (or ship) rat Rates Rattus predation, was effectively controlled in the breeding territories, has not proved to be correct. An alternative hypothesis assumes that cat predation, mainly on young birds, is limiting monarch recovery. Control of feral cats has been undertaken since 2010, but the implementation of a new trapping method (leg-hold traps) combined with a significant increase in cat trapping effort, has coincided with an increase in the number of cats culled, as well as monarch post-fledging survival in 2016 and 2017.

Most species showed a preference for lowlands and ravines, and some showed an association of combinations of these two reliefs with hillsides and hilltops. These preferences might be related to distribution of preferred food, nesting microhabitats, and thermoregulation.

Park cemeteries are dominated by vegetation because they are managed to simulate traditional parks, and thus, could contribute to the conservation of native fauna in cities. We present the first study on how patch variables (cemetery size and vegetation density) and landscape variables (vegetation cover and road density within 1 km) influence the richness and abundance of native birds in urban park cemeteries. During summer and autumn, we surveyed birds in park cemeteries in the Mediterranean city of Santiago, Chile – a large Latin American city located in a biodiversity hotspot. We recorded 42 bird species (38 native and 4 exotic). We found that cemeteries surrounded by high vegetation cover supported more native birds, whereas cemeteries surrounded by high road density supported low native bird abundance. We also found a seasonal effect: cemeteries supported more individuals of native birds in autumn than in summer, probably due to birds migrating to our study area from higher latitude, altitude, and surrounding environments, in their search for milder weather conditions. Our findings demonstrate that park cemeteries host a variety of native birds, which contributes to maintain biodiversity in urban landscapes.

We studied the European Honey Buzzard (Pernis apivorus) on its southern African non-breeding grounds to examine changes in sex and age ratios over a period of recent population expansion (2002–2017). Photographs from multiple open sources were analysed. The adult population was found to be overwhelmingly female (93.3%) with no significant variation over months, years, or latitudes. This supports the arrival-time hypothesis, which states that the sex responsible for establishing the breeding territory (the male in honey buzzard) will spend the non-breeding period closest to the breeding grounds, allowing them to reduce intrasexual competition for breeding territories. Juvenile and second year birds (41.6% of the population) were more common at lower elevations, as well as further south in the sub-region. This is likely due to a funnelling effect of inexperienced juvenile birds further south and to coastal zones. In addition, juvenile birds do not return to the breeding grounds for at least 2 years, so may be more likely to migrate further south. Finally, second year birds increase later in the austral summer. This may be a result of both juvenile birds moulting into more adult plumage, and a southward intra-continental movement of young honey buzzards in Africa.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01736-w.pdf,link.springer.com,honey-buzzard,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.55313824040652,"['honey buzzard', 'european honey buzzard', 'pernis apivorus']",862

With the combined effort of several institutions, the abundance, location, dispersion, habitat availability, and climatic conditions of areas occupied by the species were determined. Although the species’ extent of occurrence is extensive (263,919 km2) only 29% of this constitutes area of occupancy. Published estimates indicate a series of isolated populations containing from four macaws to 215. Macaws occurred in 35 populations in four regions of 16 states containing an estimated 1,563–3,263 macaws; lower than required for long-term viability. Within regions, neighbouring populations were separated by an average of 68 km. The extent of occurrence is heterogeneous, and macaws inhabit areas that differ in elevation, precipitation, temperature, and forest cover. Higher local abundances occur in landscapes where annual precipitation is ≥1,100 mm, and primary forest availability ≥1,800 km2. Although the existence of undetected macaw groups in Mexico is possible, these are likely to contain only small numbers of individuals, as most detected areas with macaws contain less than 40 individuals, and larger concentrations are more likely to be noticed due to their conspicuous behaviour. The species is threatened primarily by its low overall abundance, fragmented distribution, and forest loss around populations with the highest abundance. With the information generated, it is possible to design and implement specific management and conservation strategies at different geographic scales for the recovery and maintenance of the species in Mexico.

Knowledge of nomadic species movements is poor but is necessary to understand life histories and develop appropriate conservation strategies. Objectives We provide a first quantification of nomadism among Australia’s arid bird community, which is presumed to be highly nomadic, by measuring variation in species’ occurrence and abundance among years to determine whether there are clear nomadic and non-nomadic strategists. Methods We surveyed birds annually from 2012 to 2016. We measured how many years each species was present at a site and estimated inter-annual variability in species abundance, using both measures to infer species movement patterns. We used results to inform existing movement classifications. Results Most arid species showed low site persistence, with species detected at the same site, on average, 1.8 out of the five survey years. Movement varied along a continuum rather than grouping into distinct nomadic and non-nomadic groups. Species classified as nomadic showed higher variation in abundance and lower site persistence than species classified as resident. Our method of quantifying nomadism closely replicated existing expert-derived movement classifications of arid zone bird species. Conclusions Rather than a fixed attribute, movements of many species in our study can be heavily environment-dependent, and individuals of a single species can display a continuum of movements in different times and places. This complicates the conservation of species, but the growing recognition of the complexity of species movements offers opportunities for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between species and environment.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-021-01343-2.pdf,link.springer.com,pardalote,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-5.57670953903743,,192

Here, we compared the effectiveness of sustainable-use Protected Areas (PAs) and Community-based Conservation (CBC) arrangements for the conservation of migratory waterbirds that breed on seasonal riverine sandy beaches in Brazilian Amazonia. We modeled local population responses of four migratory waterbird species on 155 beaches along a ~1,600 km section of a major tributary of the Amazon, as a function of community enforcement, official protection status, human pressure and landscape features. We show that 21 community-protected beaches within the study area host more than 80% of all sampled birds. Black Skimmers showed the most dramatic response, with breeding numbers 135-fold larger in CBC arrangements compared to beaches with no official protection status. The same pattern was observed for nesting Large-Billed and Yellow-Billed Terns. For the Near Threatened Orinoco Goose, PA status was the strongest predictor of local population size.

In northern Australia’s vast tropical savannas, arboreal mammals are of particular conservation concern, as many have exhibited rapid population declines in recent decades. To understand the extent to which arboreal vertebrates compete for tree hollows in these savannas, we used motion-activated cameras to estimate rates of hollow visitation (i.e. individuals seen at the hollow entrance) and hollow use (i.e. individuals seen entering or exiting a hollow) by all vertebrate species at 29 hollows over a nine-month wet season period in the tropical savanna of Melville Island, Australia. We assessed the frequency of interactions between vertebrate species at the tree hollows. We recorded 21 vertebrate species visiting hollows, with larger hollows most frequently visited: 84% with entrance diameter > 10 cm. Larger-bodied mammal species were more likely to use larger hollows, in larger trees, at greater heights. However, smaller-bodies species also visited and used large hollows. The brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus) used relatively shallow hollows close to the ground, and these hollows were most frequently visited by monitors (Varanus spp.) and snakes. This arboreal rodent has declined severely in recent decades, most likely due to predation by feral cats, and it is noteworthy that their hollow selection behaviour may be associated with increased predation risk. Our study highlights the importance of large tree hollows for a range of taxa in the tropical savannas of northern Australia and the potential impact of reductions in the density of large hollows on hollow-dependent species.

Dramatic reductions in the abundance of insects are likely to have consequences for other taxa at higher trophic levels such as predators and parasites. Pesticides, fertilizers and agricultural land use are likely candidates accounting for such reductions in the abundance of insects. Here we surveyed the abundance of flying insects, and the reduction in the abundance of insects as a consequence of intensive reduction in agricultural practice linked to fertilizer use and pesticide use. Finally we demonstrated consistency in abundance of birds among study sites. We demonstrated that the use of fertilizers and pesticides had reduced the abundance of insects, with consequences for the abundance of insectivorous bird species such as Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica), House Martins (Delichon urbicum) and Swifts (Apus apus). Juvenile Barn Swallows were negatively affected by the reduced abundance of insects and hence the reproductive success of insectivorous bird species. These effects imply that the abundance of insects could be reduced by the availability of insect food. These effects of intensive agriculture on insect food abundance are likely to have negative impacts on populations of insects and their avian predators.

The boreal forests of North America support billions of birds of over 300 species. The region remains mostly intact but
is expected to undergo major changes over the next century due to anthropogenic climate change. This warming, and resulting changes
in moisture regimes, are altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics, and will likely result in expansion of grasslands and deciduous
forests, strongly challenging bird species to keep pace. We present a vulnerability-adaptation framework to guide bird conservation
based on species’ individual vulnerability and exposure to climate change. For sensitive species with declining populations, conservation
should focus on management of current threats and species recovery in situ to improve adaptive capacity and facilitate future shifts in
distribution. Sensitive species with high exposure to climate change may warrant more extensive intervention, such as habitat
manipulation or even translocation. For species with lower sensitivity and stable populations, but high climate change exposure, long-
term investments in protecting refugia and “stepping stones” will be most effective. In general, across all species, land-based approaches
that “conserve nature’s stage” by promoting geophysical diversity and habitat connectivity, maintaining natural disturbance dynamics,
and facilitating broad shifts in bird distribution may prove most effective in maintaining species diversity. Implementation of this
framework will require large-scale, interagency coordination on recovery plans, as well as adaptive forest management, designation of
critical habitat, and land protection. Challenges include data gaps, uncertainty about future conditions, coordination of conservation
actions during the nonbreeding periods, and the region’s vast scale. However, given the region’s continental importance, successful
implementation of this framework could benefit birds throughout the western hemisphere.",https://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss1/art13/ACE-ECO-2019-1363.pdf,ace-eco.org,bernier,2022-04-09,0,1,1,1,1,-5.6079792931825,,1098

Due to the high concentration of these species, any dangers affecting this passage can be threatening at a population scale. This study therefore aims to describe the migratory behaviour of these 34 species and subsequently to identify the dangers involved in passage through the area. Collision with anthropogenic obstacles was regarded as the main threat in the coastal plain. Ten (40%) of the species studied and observed in autumn 2011 were flying at the lowest altitudes and are therefore under threat on migration through the bottleneck due to overhead power lines, buildings, traffic and hunting. Planned infrastructural developments with heights of up to 200 m (e.g. towers, wind farms) pose a future threat for an additional 13 (52%) of the study species observed in autumn, making a total of 23 species that would be threatened. Only two species, Pygmy Cormorant Microcarbo pygmaeus and Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, can be expected to maintain their currently safe passage in future as they migrate mainly above 200 m above ground level. In spring 2012, all 14 (100%) of the species that used the coastal plain as flyway, migrated below 50 m and are therefore imminently threatened by collision. Although birds migrating over the Caspian Sea were concentrated at the lower altitudes, there was no identifiable threat for migrants using this flyway, but hazards can be expected in the oil production areas further south.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C0EAECE33DE50416FC2FF8A32A467F1C/S095927091500009Xa.pdf/div-class-title-migratory-behaviour-of-bird-species-occurring-in-critical-numbers-at-besh-barmag-bottleneck-in-azerbaijan-div.pdf,cambridge.org,marsh-harrier,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-5.619709581939108,"['grey heron', 'microcarbo pygmaeus', 'pygmy cormorant', 'ardea cinerea']",746

Studies showed that conservation value of abandoned farmland has differed among studies and regions, and thus is difficult to predict. However, predicting the effects of farmland abandonment on biodiversity remains vital to the development of appropriate conservation strategies. Here, we compared the species-, community-, and functional group-level habitat suitability of abandoned farmland for birds by comparison with active farmland (pasture, cropland, and rice paddy) and natural wetland on Hokkaido, Japan, over a study area of 400 km × 500 km. Results differed markedly between functional groups. The abundance and species richness of grassland species in abandoned farmland were higher than that in active farmland, and comparable to that in wetland. In contrast, abundance and richness of bare-ground species was highest in active farmland. For most species, interactive effects between climate variables and abandoned farmland were not significant, suggesting a consistent habitat suitability of abandoned farmland irrespective of varied climatic conditions. Our results suggest that abandoned farmland plays an important role as habitat for grassland and forest species at large scales; farmland abandonment provides a valuable alternative habitat for species whose primary habitats have been lost to agricultural expansion. Especially, abandoned farmland in warmer areas in Hokkaido would represent a potential mitigation to the negative effects of wetland loss. A functional group approach synthesizes varied species-level responses and allows for a comprehensive understanding of the habitat suitability of abandoned farmland. Adopting this approach will contribute to establishing appropriate conservation strategies.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-021-02178-8.pdf,link.springer.com,rheinard,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.62101729683406,,359

However, different species vary considerably in their resistance to the effects of drought. This study aimed to estimate the relative species richness and the colonization and extinction rates in a bird community during an acute drought event in the Brazilian Caatinga. We mist-netted birds during 3 years throughout seven field seasons in two sampling plots to estimate community parameters using multi-season dynamic occupancy models. The relative richness to the regional species pool varied considerably during the study period (16–49%) with markedly low values in the severe onset of the drought. The estimates in the savanna were higher than those in the shrubby-woodland plot (~ 42 vs ~ 31 species, respectively). Pollinators and seed dispersers were characterized by median to high colonization (30–69%) and local extinction rates (37–69%), indicating low site fidelity. By contrast, granivores and insectivores made up the resident component of the community, with low local extinction and colonization rates (< 30%). Our results indicate that the diversity of Caatinga bird assemblages may decline markedly during severe droughts, primarily as a result of the displacement of species that exploit resources whose availability decreases drastically in abnormally dry years. Considering the climate scenarios predicted for tropical arid and semiarid regions worldwide, we believe that pollinators and seed dispersers will be especially vulnerable to population decline and local extinctions, which will alter community structure and the persistence of ecosystem services.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43388-020-00016-z.pdf,link.springer.com,sanford,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.62662320931353,,614

However, the mechanisms and reasons underlying such negative changes are often not fully understood, making it difficult to identify effective conservation measures to recover populations. In this study, we focused on local changes in the abundance and distribution of calling male Corncrakes Crex crex in relation to: (1) within- and between-season site fidelity of adult males, (2) spatial distribution of territories in consecutive years and (3) the effect of habitat conditions on population size. We counted the number of calling males at ten randomly selected study plots (1 km2) in 2014–2018. Additionally, males were caught and individually marked in years 2015–2017. We found significant between-year changes in Corncrake abundance, from a 34% decrease to a 21% increase. On average, 32% of males established territories in the same locations as males recorded in the previous year. Breeding site fidelity was very low, with only 2–5% of males recaptured in the following year. Males selected areas characterized by higher values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index–higher values indicate more biomass) than on average within the study area. Population size in a particular year was significantly affected by the NDVI of the previous year but not by the NDVI in the current breeding season. We suppose that Corncrakes may exhibit a nomadic breeding behavior, and settle at territories when they encounter optimal habitat conditions. Moreover, as population size was negatively correlated with habitat conditions at the beginning of the previous breeding season, we suppose that local population changes may reflect more general trends in a whole population rather than local breeding success. Therefore, we highlight the need for better knowledge of Corncrake dispersal within the main European population and for the coordination of monitoring and conservation efforts, especially in those regions where most Corncrakes breed.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-020-01827-z.pdf,link.springer.com,corncrake,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.64124312266066,"['crex crex', 'corncrake']",554

Here we examined these complex interactions considering avian diversity across 26 sampling sites, each of which comprised of three sampling points located across a gradient of disturbance: core native habitat fragment, fragment edge, and non-native adjacent matrix. The 78 sampling points were further nested within three neotropical biomes—Amazonia, Cerrado and Pantanal—in central-western Brazil. Matrix type consisted of cattle pastures in the Amazon and teak plantations in the Pantanal and Cerrado. We considered the interactive effects of (1) disturbance-context: fragment core, edge and adjacent matrix, (2) matrix type: tree plantation or cattle pastures, both subject to varying land-use intensity, and (3) native habitat configuration (fragment size, shape and isolation) on bird species richness, abundance and composition. Based on point-count surveys, we recorded 210 bird species. Bird species richness and abundance declined across the disturbance gradient, while genus composition only differed within the adjacent matrix, particularly cattle-pastures. The effect of native habitat area was positive but only detected at fragment edges. Overall bird diversity increased at sites characterized by higher availability of either relict trees within pasture landscapes or old-growth trees within teak plantation landscapes. The core of native fragments played a primary role in ensuring the persistence of bird diversity, regardless of fragment size. In contrast to pastures, tree plantations likely harbour a higher proportion of forest-dependent species while bird diversity can be further enhanced by reduced management intensity in both matrix types. Strategies to maximize avian persistence should not only include retaining native habitats, but also maximizing the size of core native habitats. Likewise, more structurally complex matrix types should be encouraged while maintaining low levels of land-use intensity.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-021-02275-8.pdf,link.springer.com,tyranneutes,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-5.64141313319234,,234

For conservation planning, we used niche models for species endemic to the Albertine Rift and those that are globally threatened. We assessed where to conserve these species using three scenarios: (1) a baseline assuming equal conservation costs across all grid cells in the study area, (2) a scenario locking in existing protected areas (i.e. always selecting them by default) and assessing which unprotected areas require conservation, and (3) a scenario considering mining planned across the region. Marxan analyses produced similar results for the three scenarios, highlighting the importance of existing protected areas and the value of several community-managed or provincial protected areas in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The current protected area network covers 134,246 km2 and an additional 64,586 km2 would be required to ensure the conservation of all threatened and endemic species outside the parks and wildlife reserves. However, if trying to avoid mining concessions this increases to 145,704 km2, an area larger than the existing protected areas.

Anthropogenic climate change and habitat loss pose major threats to grassland breeding birds, the most rapidly declining
group of birds in continental North America. Although previous studies have investigated grassland breeding bird responses to land
management, few empirical studies explore their responses to climatic variation or its interactions with land management, which warrant
urgent conservation attention. We evaluated the effects of climate and land management parameters on an indicator species for grassland
breeding birds, the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), a Neotropical migrant of conservation concern whose global
population has declined by more than two thirds since 1970. We quantified Grasshopper Sparrow responses to climate variation, land
management actions, and their interactions in the Platte River Valley, Nebraska, in the North American Great Plains, using six years
of mark-recapture data collected via the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. We implemented
generalized linear mixed models to estimate avian population trends (adult abundance and productivity) in response to changes in
precipitation and temperature as well as cattle grazing, haying, and prescribed burning. Our models showed that climatic variation,
especially spring precipitation, was the most important driver of avian population trends. Grasshopper Sparrow abundance declined
with increasing spring precipitation, but prescribed burns helped mitigate this effect and were positively related to productivity, especially
during years of lower spring temperatures. Our findings demonstrate the vulnerability of grassland bird population trends to ongoing
and predicted climate change as well as the potential of land management actions to mitigate some negative effects of climate change
on grassland breeding birds.",https://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art4/ACE-ECO-2020-1515.pdf,ace-eco.org,sauterelles,2022-04-08,0,1,1,1,1,-5.64750294346613,"['ammodramus savannarum', 'grasshopper sparrow']",790

Foraging range and total distance covered were positively correlated with trip duration but did not differ across breeding stages.

Several breeding sites host an unusually large number of breeding species, but these known richness hotspots are scattered throughout the region and we were unable to identify any clear gradients in species richness that might explain why some sites are so species rich.

This study illustrates how to progress this approach, and infers that under average rainfall conditions, the general trend is for estimated superpopulation rates of increase to be negative, though for only a few species is this occurring with strong belief.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10651-021-00510-7.pdf,link.springer.com,cladorhynchus,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-5.65750151814594,,293

While the effects of particular stressors, such as parasitism, may be unimportant in a large, healthy population, they can be serious and even devastating in situations characterised by a restricted geographic range, or by fragmented or reduced population sizes. We apply this idea to nest parasitism of threatened Neotropical bird species that exist in small populations, focusing on dipteran nest parasites in the genus Philornis. We review the literature on Philornis parasitism exerting negative pressure on bird populations that have become small and isolated due to human actions and present a new case of Philornis parasitism of a threatened hummingbird species. Our aim is to raise awareness about the exacerbating effect that nest parasites can have on small and declining bird populations; especially when biological information is scarce. The five reviewed cases involve two species of Darwin’s Finches in the Galápagos Islands attacked by the invasive P. downsi, two species of hawks on islands in the Caribbean attacked by the native P. pici and P. obscura, and the Yellow Cardinal Gubernatrix cristata in southern South America attacked by an unknown Philornis species. We also present new documentation of parasitism of a threatened hummingbird species in mainland Ecuador by an unidentified Philornis species. We recommend more field studies to determine the presence of nest parasites in bird populations worldwide to improve understanding how nest parasites affect bird fitness and population viability and to allow time to act in advance if needed.

The results showed that the combined method and direct observation were similar and most effective than mist netting for detecting species occupancy, although detection rates ranged widely among bird groups, while some large species were poorly detected by all the methods used.

Methods We selected 34 1-km radius landscape units, where the abundance of birds and invertebrates was sampled in the canopy and understory. Bird density as well as the abundance and richness of invertebrates were considered as dependent variables and analysed using Generalized Linear Mixed Model and Structural Equation Models. Remote-sensing indices of forest degradation were included as predictors. Results Eight indices of forest degradation affected canopy and understory invertebrates differently. Unlike invertebrates, bird abundance was affected by a smaller number of degradation indices, forest amounts as well as the cover of understory and canopy. Only two forest degradation indices had a comparable effect on bird abundance and invertebrates. We found causal relationships between understory invertebrates and the abundance of understory birds (all species and the small-sized ones), but also invertebrate abundance × forest cover interactions affected the abundance of a bird species.

Trait-based assessments predict that specialist and range-restricted species are among those most likely to be at risk of extinction from such changes.

We use an established Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) protocol to describe the curious range-restriction of the globally threatened White-tailed Swallow (Hirundo megaensis) to a small area in southern Ethiopia. We find that, across a range of modelling approaches, the distribution of this species is well described by two climatic variables, maximum temperature and dry season precipitation. These same two variables have been previously found to limit the distribution of the unrelated but closely sympatric Ethiopian Bush-crow (Zavattariornis stresemanni). We project the future climatic suitability for both species under a range of climate scenarios and modelling approaches. Both species are at severe risk of extinction within the next half century, as the climate in 68–84% (for the swallow) and 90–100% (for the bush-crow) of their current ranges is predicted to become unsuitable. Intensive conservation measures, such as assisted migration and captive-breeding, may be the only options available to safeguard these two species. Their projected disappearance in the wild offers an opportunity to test the reliability of SDMs for predicting the fate of wild species.

Results of models of species associated with arid scrublands or that nest on the ground strongly supported our hypotheses, whereas those of species associated with coniferous forests or that nest in cavities did not. Associations between climate variables and the abundances of other trait-based groups were diverse. Our results suggest that species in arid areas may be negatively affected by increased temperature and aridity, but species in nearby areas that are cooler and less arid may respond positively to those fluctuations in climate.

We followed mortality causes, comparing them between migration and stationary phases of annual cycle, as well as between two distinct populations. Nineteen Ospreys, both juveniles and adults, were equipped with GPS loggers in 2017–2020 in two populations in western and eastern Poland and followed on their autumn migration. We calculated the distance they covered on the migration, number of stopover days, migration duration, daily distances covered and departure dates to compare them between age and sex classes and between the eastern and western populations. Ospreys from the western and eastern populations showed a partial migratory divide. While the first migrated through a western flyway, the second followed a central flyway, resulting in crossing the Mediterranean Sea in distant passes that affected the distance covered. Annual mortality reached at least 67% in juveniles and at least 57% in adults. We showed that two distinct Osprey populations in Poland revealed a partial migratory divide, with one covering greater distances over sea and deserts over the central flyway.

Productivity is high (1.9 chicks per cavity), probably reflecting the absence of nest competitors and predators. Food sources are abundant and much of the island is inaccessible to trappers, so many nests are successful each year. Historically harvest has involved taking only chicks from trees in a few traditional patches.

Parrots (Order Psittaciformes) are especially vulnerable because they are the most heavily traded group of birds globally under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) appendices. Singapore’s involvement in the global pet bird trade as a transhipment hub is well documented, particularly for parrots. Yet, much less is known about the links between its domestic and international trade. We attempt to quantify this relationship by comparing bird trade data on the CITES database with past market surveys of pet shops, complemented with semi-structured interviews with 30 parrot owners in Singapore. We report a decline in total imports and exports of CITES-listed birds in Singapore from 2005 to 2016, consistent with global trends after the European Union trade ban on wild bird imports. However, parrots continue to make up the majority of total imports; and there was a yearly increase in the percentage of parrot imports out of total imports. In addition, we report a difference in imports and exports of 54,207 CITES I, II and III listed birds into Singapore i.e. birds imported but not re-exported. A substantial proportion of these birds were possibly channelled into the domestic pet trade or used as breeding stock. Interviews with parrot owners confirmed the growing demand and popularity of parrots and particularly of larger species. We conclude that the domestic demand for parrots may have been previously underestimated, and make recommendations to manage Singapore’s international and domestic pet bird trade such as implementing a licensing and records system to track the movement of birds.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/16430B7F412A6ABDA7E407CEE7774E13/S0959270919000182a.pdf/div-class-title-flying-into-extinction-understanding-the-role-of-singapore-s-international-parrot-trade-in-growing-domestic-demand-div.pdf,cambridge.org,crocias,2022-04-14,0,0,1,1,1,-5.725658886045859,,780

Two contrasting conservation strategies have therefore been proposed: land sharing (the integration of biodiversity conservation in low-intensity agriculture) and land sparing (the spatial separation of high-yielding agriculture and areas for conservation). Despite the large academic interest in this field, only few studies have taken into account stakeholders’ perspectives of these strategies when assessing conservation implications. We modeled the effects of three land-use scenarios (a business-as-usual, a land-sharing, and a land-sparing scenario), developed together with regional stakeholders, on the habitat area of 13 regionally endangered bird species in the Middle Mulde River Basin (Saxony, Germany). We used random forest models based on environmental variables relating to land-use/cover, climate and soil characteristics, occurrence of linear landscape elements (hedges and tree rows), and distance to water and major roads. Responses to the three land-use scenarios were species-specific, but extensively managed permanent grassland and the density of forest edges were positively associated with the occurrence of most bird species. Overall, the land-sharing scenario provided the largest breeding habitat area: 76% of the species had a significant (p < 0.05) increase in breeding habitat, and none showed a significant decrease. Our findings confirm that balancing the different, often contrasting habitat requirements of multiple species is a key challenge in conservation and landscape management.

Since establishing the country's first national parks in the 1960s, Thailand's forest cover has been reduced from 53% of the country (1) to about 22.8% or 111,010 km2 (2). Unofficial estimates, however, put Thailand's forest cover at less than 20% (3). In 1989 the government banned commercial logging; a ban that remains in force today. Nevertheless, the annual rate of forest loss remains at approximately 1%. Illegal logging and agricultural expansion are the main causes of deforestation. Consequently, today large parts of the country, including extensive areas in national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, are covered in degraded forest or grasslands dominated by herbaceous weeds. Over most of northern Thailand, large vertebrates such as wild elephants, rhinos and wild cattle are either gone or on the brink of disappearing and many of the larger bird species such as hornbills are barely surviving. In the south, there is perhaps no better example than the current threat to the last remaining known population of Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi at Khao Nor Chuchi, which is discussed elsewhere in this Bulletin. Black-and-yellow Broadbill, © David and John Cooper Restoring conservation forests
A positive development in Thailand in recent years has been the rapid increase in public awareness of the problems caused by deforestation. It is now generally accepted that further forest loss will cause more extreme floods and droughts, damage to watersheds, loss of biodiversity and impoverishment of rural communities. Complete protection of all remaining forest is unlikely, due to economic and legal constraints. Therefore, to maintain the current level of forest cover, or indeed to increase it, deforestation must be balanced by reforestation. This need is reflected in the National Forest Policy, which stipulates that 40% of the country should be forested, including 25% designated as conservation forest. In an attempt to work towards this target, many former logging concessions were designated as national parks or wildlife sanctuaries after the logging ban. This enlarged the protected areas system to 91 national parks and 42 wildlife sanctuaries, covering more than 73,000 km2 or 14.3% of the country (as of 24/12/99, data from the Royal Forest Department). Consequently, many conservation areas were already extensively deforested before they acquired protected status. If such areas are to fulfil their statutory functions of wildlife conservation and watershed protection, the native forest must be restored. Rehabilitation and restoration of degraded ecosystems are extremely important components of in situ conservation, as identified in the Convention on Biodiversity, but research on the biological aspects of the problem has been neglected. Attempts to recreate natural forest ecosystems are hindered by their complexity. Any individual forest type may contain several hundred tree species, each of which may have evolved intricate relationships with hundreds of other organisms, such as herbivores, pollinators and seed-dispersers. Restoration of natural forest ecosystems, therefore, requires a vast amount of ecological information, of which only a small fraction is currently known. We need to understand how forests regenerate naturally, identify the factors limiting regeneration and develop effective methods to counteract them and thus accelerate regeneration, for example through planting tree seedlings.",,orientalbirdclub.org,rayadito,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.75199874775134,['pitta gurneyi'],1000

Alongside this, there are critical gaps in the representation of coastal wetlands across the protected area networks of many countries in this region (e.g. Viet Nam, Indonesia, Malaysia), hindering effective conservation. Although a better understanding of the value of coastal wetlands to people and their importance to migratory species is necessary, governments and other stakeholders need to do more to strengthen the conservation of these ecosystems by improving protected area coverage, habitat restoration, and coastal governance and management.

We compared the relative abundance of the birds among the three zones with increasing disturbance and modeled the relationship between the bird abundance with the micro- and landscape-habitat conditions, with Poisson generalized linear model regression. The relative abundance of the three bird species varied according to the habitat features and disturbance level. The abundance of White-bellied Antbirds was higher in forests and thickets than shrubland fragments; Barred Antshrike was more abundant in shrubland and thickets than in forest fragments, and Pale-breasted Spinetail had the highest abundance in shrubland and the lowest in forest fragments.

Herein, we use the Great-billed Seed-finch (Sporophila maximiliani), a songbird threatened with extinction in most Brazilian biomes, as an example. To identify scenarios that could result in viable populations in nature, we considered an introduction successful when the chance of surviving for 100 years was > 90%.

The reintroductions would be successful if a minimum of 24 individuals were released in one single area or in three different areas, both with supplementation of four pairs per area over 5 years. However, few regions were appropriate for reintroduction from captivity, such as the central part of the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest in the species distribution range.

We searched Miami-Dade County, Florida, and nearby areas for natural cavities and holes excavated by woodpeckers, recording attributes of potential nest trees. We inspected all cavities with an elevated video inspection system to determine occupancy by parrots or other birds. We mapped nearly 4000 citizen science observations of parrots in our study area corresponding to our study period, and used these to construct range maps, comparing them to our nesting observations. Not all parrots reported or observed in our study area were actively breeding. Some parrots were observed at tree cavities, which previous studies have suggested is evidence of reproduction, but our inspections with an elevated video inspection system suggest they never initiated nesting attempts. Several parrot species did successfully nest in tree cavities, Red-masked Parakeets (Psittacara erythrogenys) and Orange-winged Parrots (Amazona amazonica) being the most common (n = 7 and 6 nests, respectively). These two parrots had similar nesting requirements, but Orange-winged Parrots use nests with larger entrance holes, which they often enlarge. Geographic analysis of nests combined with citizen science data indicate that parrots are limited to developed areas. The most common parrots were less abundant cavity nesters than the native birds which persist in Miami’s urban areas, and far less abundant than the invasive European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris).

Many studies have focused on inter-individual variation in feeding rate, yet this measure may not accurately reflect the total amount of food (i.e. energy) provided by parents if there is large variation in the quantity and quality of preys at each feeding. Here, we explored the relative role of individual (sex, age, body condition), breeding (hatching date, brood size) and environmental (temperature) factors on feeding rate, prey number, size and quality, and their contribution to total prey biomass delivered to the nestlings of 164 Collared Flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) parents in 98 nests. Preys delivered to the nest were mainly larvae (53.6%) and flying insects (45.6%). Feeding rate increased with brood size and age, and was higher in males than females. Mean prey number decreased, but mean prey size increased, as the season progressed and parents feeding their brood with primary larvae brought more preys per visit. Relationships between feeding rate, mean prey number and size remained when taking into account the provisioning quality: parents brought either a large number of small prey or a small number of larger items, and the force of the trade-offs between feeding rate and mean prey number and size depended on the quality of the provisioning of the parents. Whatever the percentage of larvae among preys in the provisioning, the variance in total prey biomass was foremost explained by feeding rate (65.1% to 76.6%) compared to mean prey number (16.4% to 26%) and prey size (2.7% to 4%). Our study shows that variation in feeding rate, prey number, size, but not quality (i.e. percentage of larvae), were influenced by individual factors (sex and age) and breeding decisions (brood size and timing of breeding) and that, whatever the provisioning strategy adopted, feeding rate was the best proxy of the total biomass delivered to the nestlings.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00247-8,avianres.biomedcentral.com,azurée,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.78400731038466,"['ficedula albicollis', 'collared flycatcher']",376

Here, we reviewed the scientific literature on habitat associations across its European breeding range, in relation to distribution, breeding numbers, nesting substrates, food and foraging habitats, to identify optimal habitat management measures. Large-scale distribution seemed related to the availability, but not dominance, of woodland landscapes; abundance was generally higher in woodland than on farmland. However, abundance in woodland increased with additional structural diversity and proximity to farmland, and abundance on farmland increased with greater availability of non-farmland features. Nesting occurred most frequently on trees (secondarily on bushes) but we found geographical differences in the type of nesting substrate, with thorny bushes being used more frequently in the north, and open canopy trees in the south. Turtle doves fed on a wide spectrum of seeds with a predominance of wild, particularly early-flowering, plants; but we could not identify a single plant species whose abundance determined turtle dove numbers. Across the distribution range, a shift from wild to cultivated seeds occurred as the season progressed. However, interventions should favour the availability and access to wild seeds. Efficient management interventions depend on the dominant habitat; overall, interventions should seek to augment landscape heterogeneity by increasing the mixing of farmland and woodland.

Managing seabirds is challenging, requiring conservation actions at sea (e.g. Marine Protected Areas - MPAs) and on land (e.g. protection of breeding sites). Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) have been successfully used to identify sites of global importance for the conservation of bird populations, including breeding seabirds. The challenge of identifying suitable IBAs for tropical seabirds is exacerbated by high levels of dispersal, aseasonal and asynchronous breeding. The western Indian Ocean supports ~19 million breeding seabirds of 30 species, making it one of the most significant tropical seabird assemblages in the world. Within this is the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), encompassing 55 islands of the Chagos Archipelago, which supports 18 species of breeding seabird and one of the world’s largest no-take MPAs. Between January and March in 1975 and 1996, eight and 45 islands respectively were surveyed for seabirds and the data used to designate 10 islands as IBAs. A further two were proposed following an expedition to 26 islands in February/March 2006. Due to the historic and restricted temporal and spatial nature of these surveys, the current IBA recommendations may not accurately represent the archipelago’s present seabird status and distribution. To update estimates of the BIOT breeding seabird assemblage and reassess the current IBA recommendations, we used seabird census data collected in every month except September from every island, gathered during 2008–2018. The maximum number of breeding seabirds for a nominal year was 281,596 pairs of 18 species, with three species making up 96%: Sooty Tern Onychoprion fuscatus - 70%, Lesser Noddy Anous tenuirostris - 18% and Red-footed Booby Sula sula - 8%. Phenology was a complex species-specific mix of synchronous and asynchronous breeding, as well as seasonal and aseasonal breeding. Nine of the 10 designated IBAs and the two proposed IBAs qualified for IBA status based on breeding seabirds. However, not every IBA qualified each year because Sooty Terns periodically abandoned breeding islands and Tropical Shearwater Puffinus bailloni breeding numbers dropped below IBA qualifying criteria in some years. Further, one survey per year does not always capture the periodic breeding of some tropical seabirds. We propose therefore, that IBAs in BIOT are better designated at the island cluster level rather than by specific island and require two surveys six months apart per year. This work highlights the merits of long-term, systematic, versus incidental surveys for breeding tropical seabirds and the subsequent associated designation of IBAs.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/E84E07D38619A635F3A54104511FBED2/S0959270920000295a.pdf/div-class-title-status-and-phenology-of-breeding-seabirds-and-a-review-of-important-bird-and-biodiversity-areas-in-the-british-indian-ocean-territory-div.pdf,cambridge.org,ariel,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.7982405618605,"['tropical shearwater', 'puffinus bailloni', 'sooty tern', 'anous tenuirostris', 'lesser noddy', 'onychoprion fuscatus', 'sula sula']",658

Such links, called carry-over effects, can explain individual variation in timing or reproductive success in migratory species. Identifying the key links affecting fitness may reveal the mechanisms of species population dynamics but the current evidence for the strongest carry-over effects is equivocal. Here, we aim to assess the carry-over effects in great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a long-distance migratory songbird, using 103 full-annual tracks from three European and two Asian breeding populations. Our results showed strong positive relationships within autumn and spring migration periods and buffering capacity of the non-breeding period preventing events to carry over between these periods. Moreover, we found no profound relation between the non-breeding habitat quality or seasonality (quantified using stable isotopes and remote sensing data) and the timing of spring migration. The strongest carry-over effects occurred in individuals from the southern European breeding population compared to the northern and the central European populations. A moderate relationship between the habitat seasonality during moult and the spring migration timing indicates the importance of the complete moult. The overall weak carry-over effects of non-breeding habitat conditions found in this study contrast with previous results and imply between-species differences in these crucial relationships. Moreover, the population-specific carry-over effects highlight the importance of multi-population approach and advise caution in interpretation of results from single-population studies. Finally, the carry-over effect from the moulting period indicates the significance of a so-far neglected link in the species. Significance statement Environmental conditions vary in space and time. Therefore, migratory species adjust the timing of migration in order to maximise their fitness. However, the links between annual cycle events in multiple populations and the consequences of environmental conditions outside the breeding range are scarcely known. In this study, we used tracking data of the great reed warbler, an insectivorous bird species breeding across western Eurasia and wintering in Africa, to study a complex system of links between annual events. We found that the strength of these links differed between geographically distinct populations but not between sexes. Moreover, harsh environmental conditions during moult delayed the timing of subsequent events. Our findings could help explain large-scale differences in population size changes observed in some species and highlight the importance of energetically demanding moult period for the life of migratory species.

Here, we studied age- and sex-dependent carry-over effects from wintering to the breeding stage of a small aerial insectivorous long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) breeding in Denmark during 1984–2013. First, we used stable isotope analyses combined with ringing recoveries to identify wintering areas. Second, we found that environmental conditions as inferred by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have improved at the wintering grounds. Third, we used confirmatory path analysis to quantify the indirect effect of winter conditions on subsequent breeding success. Males delayed onset of breeding and raised fewer fledglings in the first brood when ecological conditions during the previous winter improved. This response was age dependent, since yearlings did not respond to this environmental cue but the response was increasingly stronger as males aged. Females showed a similar response to winter conditions, although not statistically significant.

As a consequence, strong selective pressures apply to favor strategies allowing individuals to choose high-quality habitat for foraging while reducing predation risk and competition. In long-distance migratory birds, such as shorebirds, the non-breeding period is considered as a key period of their annual cycle with reported effects on individual survival and subsequent reproduction. Site selection by non-breeding shorebirds should depend on habitat quality for them to ensure survival until the next breeding season. More specifically, birds should distribute in space and time according to their resource availability and specialize on feeding habitats or/and prey to reduce intraspecific competition. To test this hypothesis, we studied Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) at one of their main non-breeding sites along the French coast. We first used GPS tracking to investigate their foraging and roosting home ranges as well as core sampling to define the diversity of available habitats and their quality as feeding resources. We then compared individual habitat selection in relation to feeding home range sizes and benthic macrofauna abundances. Our results provide the first fine scale definition of shorebird movements and distribution along the non-breeding period. We found that godwits showed an extreme fidelity to restricted feeding areas (about 3.4 km2) during winter, with low overlap between individual feeding home ranges. Each bird appeared to mainly use 4–6 of the 11 available foraging habitats, with a specialization on 1 to 2 main habitats and their associated prey. However, our results did not emphasize a clear relationship between home range sizes and the quality of bird feeding sites. This study thus demonstrates the high specialization of individual non-breeding Bar-tailed godwits relying on specific foraging grounds and habitats, with important implications for the conservation of this species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01873-1.pdf,link.springer.com,rousse,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-5.82975469216418,['limosa lapponica'],404

However, in-depth research on trends in body condition is rare because decades-long datasets are not available for a majority of species. We analysed the long-term dataset of offspring covering 34&nbsp;years, male parents (40&nbsp;years) and female parents (42&nbsp;years) to find out whether the decline of Tengmalm’s owl population in western Finland is attributable to either decreased adult and/or juvenile body condition in interaction with changing weather conditions and density estimates of main foods. We found that body condition of parent owl males and females declined throughout the 40-year study period whereas the body condition of owlets at the fledging stage very&nbsp;slightly increased. The body condition of parent owls increased with augmenting depth of snow cover in late winter (January to March), and that of offspring improved with increasing precipitation in late spring (May to June). We conclude that the decreasing trend of body condition of parent owl males and females is important factor probably inducing reduced adult survival and reduced reproduction success thus contributing to the long-term decline of the Tengmalm’s owl study population. The very&nbsp;slightly increasing trend of body condition of offspring is obviously not able to compensate the overall decline of Tengmalm’s owl population, because the number of offspring in turn simultaneously decreased considerably in the long-term. The ongoing climate change appeared to work in opposite ways in this case because declining depth of snow cover will make the situation worse but increased precipitation will improve. We suggest that the main reasons for long-term decline of body condition of parent owls are interactive or additive effects of reduced food resources and increased overall predation risk due to habitat degradation (loss and fragmentation of mature and old-growth forests due to clear-felling) subsequently leading to decline of Tengmalm’s owl study population.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98447-1.pdf,nature.com,berlioz,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-5.82983426846918,,209

Nevertheless, it is also important to study common species in multiple habitats, because they represent a large proportion of biodiversity and are essential to maintain ecological functions. Interestingly, some habitats, as farmlands with permanent crops (e.g. vineyards), have been overlooked in the literature. In this study, we investigated the distribution of a widespread and common bird species, the Common Blackbird (Turdus merula), within and between the three main habitats of our study area (rural Western France). We specifically focused on (1) woodlands, (2) farmlands with a high vineyard coverage, and (3) moderately urbanized areas. Specifically, we aimed to assess the beneficial and detrimental effects of these habitats and their fine-scale composition on the presence of a common bird species, relying on a survey by point counts (nearly 100 locations). We studied the effects of habitats and gradients of fine-scale habitat composition on blackbird presence using logistic regression analyses. Blackbirds were present in all studied habitats. However, their presence varied between habitats, being lower in vineyards than in woodlands and cities. In woodlands and cities, fine-scale analyses did not reveal any component driving the species’ presence. However, we found that shrub and tree vegetation cover had a significant positive effect on blackbird presence in vineyards. Our results are in agreement with the definition of a generalist species. Interestingly, species distribution varied between habitats. The high presence of blackbirds in urban areas suggests that medium-sized cities, despite their artificialization, do not constrain the settlement of this former forest specialist and that green spaces may allow blackbirds to thrive in medium-sized cities. On the contrary, we found an impoverished presence of blackbirds in vineyards and a positive effect of vegetation on their presence in these landscapes. This suggests that permanent crops, and more generally farmlands, may impose important constraints to common species.

Roost choice of the urban forest colonies was similar to the rural forest colonies with a preference for oak trees with woodpecker holes. The distances between roosts were similar between urban and rural colonies. Habitat selection was strongly towards old forest patches.

The wild population of the Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) has recovered to approximately 4400, and several reintroduction programs have been carried out in China, Japan and Korea. Population viability analysis on this endangered species has been limited to the wild population, showing that the long-term population growth is restricted by the carrying capacity and inbreeding. However, gaps in knowledge of the viability of the reintroduced population and its drivers in the release environment impede the identification of the most effective population-level priorities for aiding in species recovery. The field monitoring data were collected from a reintroduced Crested Ibis population in Ningshan, China from 2007 to 2018. An individual-based VORTEX model (Version 10.3.5.0) was used to predict the future viability of the reintroduced population by incorporating adaptive patterns of ibis movement in relation to catastrophe frequency, mortality and sex ratio. The reintroduced population in Ningshan County is unlikely to go extinct in the next 50 years. The population size was estimated to be 367, and the population genetic diversity was estimated to be 0.97. Sensitivity analysis showed that population size and extinction probability were dependent on the carrying capacity and sex ratio. The carrying capacity is the main factor accounting for the population size and genetic diversity, while the sex ratio is the primary factor responsible for the population growth trend. A viable population of the Crested Ibis can be established according to population viability analysis.

Recently, a discussion emerged on the importance of detecting and understanding long-term fluctuations in species composition and relative abundance and whether deterministic or non-deterministic factors can explain any temporal change. However, currently, one of the main impediments to providing answers to these questions is the relatively short time series of species diversity datasets. Many datasets are limited to 2&nbsp;years and it is rare for a few decades of data to be available. In addition, long-term data typically has standardization issues from the past and/or the methods are not comparable.

While species richness did not change, species composition and relative abundance differed, indicating a significant species turn over and hence temporal change. Only 19.2% of bird species occurred during both periods. Land-cover model predictors explained part of the species richness variability but not relative abundance nor species composition changes.

Referential calls signal predator behavior in a group-living bird species ...",en,Urban life promotes delayed dispersal and family living in a non-social bird species,"In some vertebrate species, family units are typically formed when sexually mature individuals delay dispersal and independent breeding to remain as subordinates in a breeding group. This behaviour has been intensively studied in gregarious species but has also been described in non-social species where ecological and evolutionary drivers are less known. Here, we explore factors that favour delayed dispersal and family living and potential benefits associated with this strategy in a non-social, monogamous species (the burrowing owl, Athene cunicularia) occupying urban and rural habitats. Our results show that family units arise when first-year individuals, mainly males, delay their dispersal to stay in their natal nests with their parents. This delayed dispersal, while still uncommon, was more prevalent in urban (7%) than in rural (3%) habitats, and in areas with high conspecific density and productivity. Birds delaying dispersal contributed to the genetic pool of the offspring in 25% of the families analysed, but did not increase the productivity of the nests where they remained. However, their presence was related to an improvement in the body condition of chicks, which was ultimately linked to a slightly positive effect in offspring future survival probabilities. Finally, delayed dispersers were recruited as breeders in high-quality urban territories and closer to their natal nests than individuals dispersing during their first year of life. Thus, our results suggest that delaying dispersal may be mainly related to opportunities to inheriting a good quality territory, especially for males. Our study contributes to understanding the role played by habitat quality in promoting delayed dispersal and family living, not only in social but also non-social species, highlighting its impact in the ecology and evolution of animal populations.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80344-8.pdf,nature.com,fairy,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-5.87786683822285,"['athene cunicularia', 'burrowing owl']",467

The present study describes the effects of a perturbation and restoration in a reedbed habitat on a bird assemblage. We studied the bird community of a wetland of central Spain between 1995 and 2009, during which time an anthropic perturbation altered the original structure of the habitat; subsequently, as a result of restoration works, the habitat returned to its original state. We evaluated the effects on six population and physical parameters of the birds at three different phases of their life cycles (breeding, wintering and post-breeding migration seasons) before, during and after the habitat alteration. GLM was used to analyze the influence of three independent variables (year, perturbation phase and temperature). The relative abundance and the species richness values decreased when habitat was altered, but then recovered as a result of the regeneration works. This pattern was the clearest amongst specialist species. Breeding success also declined during the perturbation phase and then increased; likewise, the sex ratio changed given that the proportion of male birds increased when habitat was altered. These results are discussed in relation to changes on availability of resources in altered habitats, to the adaptive mechanisms in the exploitation of ecological requirements and to the selection of optimum and sub-optimum habitats by generalist and specialist species. Ecosystem restoration can favour the recovery of population indexes of specialist passerines, although it depends on the efficiency of the type of restoration activity performed and on the complexity of the habitat.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00190-0,avianres.biomedcentral.com,saunders,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.878156458824,,788

Since the nineteenth century, the decline in the extent of occurrence has been above 99.99%.

To understand fully observed annual changes, we need to monitor demographic rates to understand factors affecting global population size. Annual reproduction success contributes to dynamic changes in population size and age structure, so an assessment of the juvenile ratio (i.e. first winter birds as a proportion of total number aged) of overwintering waterbirds can be an important indicator of the reproductive success in the preceding breeding season. During 2016–2019, we sampled juvenile ratios among 10 key waterbird species from the wetlands in the YRF. Based on these data, we here attempt to establish a simple, efficient, focused and reliable juvenile ratio monitoring scheme, to assess consistently and accurately relative annual breeding success and its contribution to the age structure among these waterbird species. We compared juvenile ratio data collected throughout the winter and found that the optimal time for undertaking these samples was in the early stages of arrival for migratory waterbirds reaching their wintering area (early to mid-December). We recommend counting consistently at key points (i.e. those where > 1% biogeographical flyway population were counted) at sites of major flyway importance (Poyang Lake, East Dongting Lake, Shengjin Lake, Caizi Lake, Longgan Lake and Chen Lake).

We related extensive bird counts of eight species at 111 points to habitat measurements and reed age. Species differed in their preferred age class; for example, Great Reed Warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus are found mainly in up to 4-year-old reed stands, while Little Crakes Zapornia parva prefer to settle in more than 14-year-old vegetation. We expected some species to be more common in older age classes, but our results demonstrate that large parts of the reed stands become too degraded even for these “old reed” specialists. Several bird species showed an inverse u-shaped relationship to habitat characteristics associated with reed die-back, e.g. accumulation of broken reed stems, occurrence of matted reed, low vegetation height or open water areas. At present, harvested areas are small and burning of reed is prohibited, and in the future, we expect more reed die-back with declining bird numbers. Missing ice cover in wintertime because of climate warming prevents sustainable cutting of these very old reed stands. We thus recommend a cautious introduction of fire management as a measure to secure this unique bird habitat.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-022-01961-w.pdf,link.springer.com,reedling,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.90034320906782,"['zapornia parva', 'acrocephalus arundinaceus']",52

Here, we studied nest-site selection and breeding biology of the Atlantic Royal Flycatcher (Onychorhynchus swainsoni), a poorly known vulnerable bird endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We addressed nest site selection in three different levels: first, we searched for nests near and far from water to investigate whether birds could select water proximities to construct nests; second, we examined if they could select certain streams in detriment of others, and we analyzed the characteristics of used and non-used streams, and third, in streams in which nests were found, we addressed nest site selectivity by comparing a number of parameters between nest sites and random sites. Further, we provide information on breeding biology parameters related to annual fecundity. During five breeding seasons, we found 23 nests in a well-preserved forest continuum. All of the nests were constructed above water, and they were found in streams that were about 4 m in width, instead of smaller streams with about 1.5 m in width. Modeling analyses revealed that within the used streams, nests were constructed in sites with lower vegetation density in relation to random points, while stream width, water speed, and canopy cover presented no significant correlation. Atlantic Royal Flycatchers in our study had a 22-day incubation period and 24 to 27-day nestling period. Overall nest survival was comparatively high (62%), but clutch size was small (N = 2 eggs) and double-brooding was unlikely, which resulted in a low annual fecundity (1.4 ± 0.9 fledglings per reproductive female). Along the nesting streams, we found an average of 1.62 ± 0.07 breeding pairs/km. These data suggest that nesting habitat specificity and low annual fecundity are among the factors contributing to the rarity of the Atlantic Royal Flycatcher in large forest continuums and to its absence in fragmented environments.

We detail the diet of C. globulosa based on our own field observations, as well as interviews with local people and analysis of stomach contents, in the Juruá River region of Brazil. The species was observed using 51 different species of plants from 23 families. It consumed mostly fruits/seeds (69%), followed by flowers and leaves. Only 13% of direct observations were of birds foraging on the ground, with groups of up to eight individuals feeding together. Crax globulosa was observed consuming a greater variety of species of plants in the high-water season (29 species). The stomach contents of ten individuals showed that the species also feeds on invertebrates and ingests pebbles. The species has a more diverse diet in the low-water season, but still maintains a preference for fruits/seeds. As the species remains in várzea forest throughout the year, a larger supply of fruits during the high-water season is important for the species and may be one of the reasons it remains in this type of environment.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43388-020-00025-y.pdf,link.springer.com,curassow,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-5.90627276792812,"['crax globulosa', 'wattled curassow']",553

Although species endemic to islands or archipelagos have high conservation value and are vulnerable to human impacts2,3, there has been no global analysis of climate-driven extinction risk focused on island endemics. Here, we use conifers as a model system to assess extinction risk among island endemics under climate projections for 2070. We employ the emerging technique of combining native and non-native occurrence data to model climatic conditions under which each species can sustain a population4–7 and also incorporate horticultural data to model the broader range of conditions that allow short-term survival. Our projections indicate that some species will retain suitable climatic conditions, some will experience conditions completely precluding survival and others will experience intermediate-risk conditions that lead to population decline and eventual extinction. Based on different climate change models, we report island size thresholds of 400 to 20,000 km2, below which extinction risks increase. These patterns are driven by correlations among island area and the breadth of species’ realized, fundamental and tolerance niches. Notably, realized and fundamental niche breadth are positively correlated. Our results highlight management interventions needed to protect species from climate-driven extinction across islands of different sizes. Island species are at risk as the climate changes. Island conifers are used as a model species and a combination of native and non-native occurrence data allows identification of realized, tolerable and fundamental niches; linking to island size provides an estimate of extinction risk.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0530-9.pdf,nature.com,tomé,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-5.90682912133072,,1010

We identified five main roost site areas with an overall mean (± SD) monthly population size of 1 783.3 ± 505.2 rose-ringed parakeets. There was an increase in rose-ringed parakeet numbers, particularly in August and December after their breeding. Most rose-ringed parakeets were recorded in the north, with fewer in the south of the metropole; and many were located around shopping centres and parks. A total of seven bird species communally shared roost sites with rose-ringed parakeets, with the non-native common myna Acridotheres tristis being the species that frequently shared roosts with parakeets.

Density and population size of the endangered Sierra Madre Sparrow across central Mexico,"Density estimation is fundamental for animal conservation. Yet, ignoring the effects of detectability can bias density estimations, resulting in unreliable management strategies for threatened species. We estimated the density of the Sierra Madre Sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi), an endangered species endemic to specific grasslands of Mexico, using hierarchical modelling techniques accounting for detectability and allowing the inclusion of covariates. These models enabled us to analyze the relationship between density and habitat characteristics, therefore providing robust estimations under different habitat scenarios. Moreover, we measured the remaining surface of subalpine grassland across central Mexico to estimate the population size of the species. We performed the study by including local community members that were familiar with the studied species in the definition of research objectives, bird surveys, and habitat characterization. We found that herb cover had a positive effect on the density of the sparrow. Hence, this habitat trait should be taken into account for guiding management, restoration, and conservation activities for the habitat of the species. Measurement of the subalpine grassland surface indicated the importance of Llano de Morales, a site located within communal lands that contains ~ 70.1% of the remaining habitat for the species. Our field-based scenario suggested that the population is composed of ~ 4089 individuals, confirming the conservation concern about the species. Because most of the subalpine grassland is located within lands owned by rural and indigenous communities, a participatory science approach is imperative for conserving the sparrow.

During 1997 and 1998, we surveyed birds and measured habitat characteristics along transects in wet meadows associated with the northern Lake Huron shoreline (NLHS) in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Using a suite of multivariate techniques, we related abundance and presence/absence of individual species to wet meadow area and habitat characteristics. Nine species were positively associated with increasing wet meadow area, which underscores the importance of large wetlands to avian conservation in the region. Bird variables also were related to habitat characteristies. Higher values of bird variables were generally associated with a suite of characteristics: more robust and dense grass/sedge vegetation, structural diversity in the horizontal and vertical planes, and increased frequency of willow shrubs. Individual species that require particular aspects of these characteristics for nesting or foraging were associated with principal components containing those aspects. In the NLHS, large wet meadows that possess these characteristics would support the greatest diversity and benefit the majority of species. However, conservation efforts that focus only on these traits will not be sufficient for all species because habitat requirements for some species are very specific (e. g., open water for mallard), and for others, habitat preferences may change from year to year in response to lake-level changes.

Efforts to document global abundance and trends have been hampered by remoteness of colonies, lack of a formal monitoring programme, and the absence of reproducible population estimates with quantifiable errors, especially for large colonies. We surveyed four historically large colonies in Russia (2018) and Alaska (2019), which together may comprise 30–50% of the global breeding population. At each colony we obtained high resolution aerial photographs using a small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS). The large size of the colonies and the minimum altitude required to identify terns made it impractical to collect imagery of the entire colony. Instead, we employed a sampling approach, with sample locations selected based on spatially balanced acceptance sampling. Statistically sampled, low altitude sUAS images provided a fast, reproducible, and rigorous count of abundance for geographically large colonies, with low disturbance, and were generally consistent with concurrent ground-based observations. Concurrence among observers in photo counts indicated high precision in counts of attending birds and unattended nests, although species attribution in mixed tern colonies remains a source of significant uncertainty. Our results indicate that the four colonies surveyed here together supported &lt;2,500 pairs of Aleutian Terns in the survey years.

Rahmani, Chairman, IUCN Bustard Specialist Group and Director, Bombay Natural History Society, OBC Bulletin 35, June 2002 Introduction
Within Asia, India is third among countries having the most threatened species of birds. Only Indonesia and the Philippines have greater numbers of threatened species. With 85 bird species listed as critical, endangered and vulnerable, and further 52 as near-threatened (1) in India, it is a big challenge for conservationists to prevent their extinction. The Bustards and Floricans comprise a group with which I have been intimately connected for the past 20 years. Four members of the Bustard family are found in India: the Indian Bustard Ardeotis nigriceps of the short grass plains and deserts; MacQueen's Bustard Chlamydotis macqueeni, a winter migrant to the desert regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat; the Lesser Florican Sypheotides indica found in the short grass plains in western and central India; and the Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengalensis of the tall, wet grasslands of the Terai and the Brahmaputra valley. All the resident bustards have been classified as endangered (1) but the Indian Bustard is approaching critical. In this short article I will restrict myself to the latter species only. Indian Bustard, male © Asad Rhamani Poaching of tigers and threats of de-notification of protected areas have dominated the Indian media so much that the slow disappearance of other endangered wildlife has been overlooked. Not many people know that the Indian Bustard is now on the brink of extinction with an estimated population possibly as low as 600-700.(1) Although its present range largely coincides with its historic range, there has been a massive decline in numbers. It has become locally extinct in almost 90% of its former range and, ironically, it has disappeared from two sanctuaries created especially to protect the species. In other sanctuaries it is declining rapidly. Previously, it was mainly poaching and habitat destruction that resulted in such a pitiful situation, but now mismanagement of the habitat, sentimental protection of certain problem animals, and apathy are creating havoc. Conservation measures
In the early 1980s, the five states of India where the Indian Bustard was still found adopted conservation measures, and eight protected areas were declared.(2,3) Despite these conservation measures, the status of the Indian Bustard has sharply deteriorated during the last 10 years. This raises the question of whether the sanctuary approach is appropriate for the protection of species that live at low densities in scattered grasslands and marginal crop fields. The sanctuary approach certainly helps in curtailing poaching but, unless appropriate habitat protection measures are taken, declaring a sanctuary for bustards does not help in the long run. Each bustard area has its own problems, a full description of which is beyond the scope of this article, but the major problems can be summarised as:",,orientalbirdclub.org,bustard,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-5.93393364899841,"['indian bustard', 'bengal florican', 'lesser florican', 'houbaropsis bengalensis', 'ardeotis nigriceps']",1000

We integrate digital elevation models with a metric of human pressure to examine changes in the amount of intact land area available for species undergoing elevational range shifts in all major mountain ranges globally (n = 1010). Nearly 60% of mountainous area is under intense human pressure, predominantly at low elevations and mountain bases. Consequently, upslope range shifts generally resulted in modeled species at lower elevations expanding into areas of lower human pressure and, due to complex topography, encountering more intact land area relative to their starting position. Such gains were often attenuated at high elevations as land-use constraints diminished and topographic constraints increased. Integrating patterns of topography and human pressure is essential for accurate species vulnerability assessments under climate change, as priorities for protecting, connecting, and restoring mountain landscapes may otherwise be misguided. It is often assumed that many species will move upslope in mountainous regions as the climate warms.

Particular attention was paid to identifying potential limitations and to provide management recommendations for future interventions. Using data from 70 nest boxes sited on power lines monitored over a 7-year period (representing 140 breeding attempts), we developed probability functions to evaluate if nest box location, in terms of distance from habitat resources and habitat composition and structure, had an effect on nest box occupancy and on the main reproductive parameters. Nest boxes were more likely to be occupied if they were located near arable fields and in areas characterized by a higher amount of incoming solar radiation. Higher fledging success was associated with fallow fields and with a moderate/low habitat structural complexity. Higher breeding success was associated with solar radiation and with greater distance from urban areas.

There are no estimates of the distances travelled by resident birds spending different amounts of time per day flying. Selection pressures similar to those due to migration are hypothesised to select for high aspect ratio wings, with low wing loading, among resident birds that spend a large amount of time per day flying. This reduces the energetic cost of flying and increases the birds’ flight range. The estimated distances that aerial foraging birds fly per day (n = 4 species), and per year (n = 3 species) ranged from 83 to 215 km, and from 38,666 to 44,716 km, respectively. To test the abovementioned hypothesis, the phylogenetically controlled and mass-adjusted wingspan, mean wing chord, wing area, wing loading and wing aspect ratio of 77 resident passerine birds, that spend different amounts of time per day flying, were compared with those of 11 migrants. A decrease in wing loading and an increase in the aspect ratio of the birds’ wings were significant predictors of an increase in the amount of time per day that the resident birds spent flying. No significant differences in the wing morphology traits between migrant, and resident birds that spend large amounts of time per day flying, were detected. The conclusion is that resident birds that spend a large amount of time per day flying have been subjected to the same selection pressures for energy-efficiency that have shaped aspects of the wing morphology traits of migrants.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01870-4.pdf,link.springer.com,karoo,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.9442710801808,,414

Blood samples were collected from 7‒8-day-old nestlings in Inner Mongolia, China between May and August of 2012 and 2013. Mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic diversity, genetic structure and inbreeding of E. jankowskii. The results of genetic diversity and inbreeding were compared to other avian species. We found an unexpectedly high level of genetic diversity in terms of mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite compared to other avian species. However, there were high levels of gene flow and minimal genetic structuring, among the fragmented breeding populations of E. jankowskii in Inner Mongolia. These findings suggest that E. jankowskii in Inner Mongolia is a metapopulation. Despite the high genetic diversity of E. jankowskii, local populations in each small patch remain at risk of extinction due to habitat loss. In addition, the E. jankowskii population has a high risk of inbreeding. To minimize further loss of genetic diversity of this endangered species, we suggest that the E. jankowskii in Inner Mongolia should be considered as a protected species for management purposes. Conservation efforts should concentrate on E. jankowskii habitat management.

In birds, individual appearance is largely determined by plumage, influencing, for example, bird attractiveness, social status and camouflage. Juveniles of most passerine species replace their nest-grown plumage during the first months of life, a process that is called post-juvenile feather moult. Using data from ten natural history collections, we show that the extent of the post-juvenile moult has increased significantly over the last 212 years (1805–2016), a trend that is positively correlated with the temperature of the environment. Therefore, it seems that birds replaced more feathers under warmer conditions, causing juveniles to appear more similar to adult birds. Moreover, in several species, we describe a male–female switch in the extent of moult, with females currently replacing more feathers than males compared to the past. These results demonstrate different biological responses to climate warming by different phenotypes. Most passerine bird species replace part of their plumage within the first year of life.

The common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula vulpecula from the Australian mainland and T.v.fuliginosus from Tasmania, were introduced multiple times to New Zealand from Australia to become one of New Zealand’s most significant pests. Although derived from two subspecies, possums in New Zealand are generally considered to be a single entity. In a previous analysis, we showed that possums in the Hawkes Bay region of New Zealand appeared to consist of at least two overlapping populations. Here, we extend that analysis using a genotype-by-sequencing approach to examine the origins and population structure of those possums and compare their genetic diversity to animals sampled from Australia. We identify two populations of each subspecies in Hawkes Bay and provide clear evidence of a contact zone between them in which a hybrid form is evident. Our analysis of private alleles shows higher rates of dispersal into the contact zone than away from it, suggesting that the contact zone functions as a sink (and hence as a barrier) between the two subspecies. Given the widespread and overlapping distribution of the two subspecies across both large islands in New Zealand, it is possible that many such contact zones exist. These results suggest an opportunity for a more targeted approach to controlling this pest by recognising sub-specific differences and identifying the contact zones that may form between them.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10530-021-02609-1.pdf,link.springer.com,d'audebert,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.95935055029249,,252

In the European Union, many wetlands are included in the EU ‘Natura 2000’ network, the main tool for biodiversity conservation over the continent, which requires the development of site-specific management plans. Clear and feasible recommendations are necessary to provide site managers with effective tools for the maintenance of biodiversity in these unstable environments. Birds are excellent umbrella species, therefore a management targeted at increasing habitat suitability for focal bird species would likely benefit broader wetland biological communities. During spring–summer 2017, we collected presence/absence data for 10 bird species of conservation interest at a site scale for 21 Natura 2000 sites. We also carried out a point count survey to detect presence/absence of four reedbed-dwelling species at 75 points. At the site level, we estimated landscape characteristics from regional GIS-layers, whereas fine-scaled habitat composition was recorded on the field within a 100 m-buffer around the 75 points. We analysed the effect of the extent of different habitats on species’ occurrence probability by means of multi-species binomial multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) at both scales. We also run species-specific MARS models to compare their performance with those of multi-species models. At the site scale, the extent of the reedbeds/mires was positively associated with the occurrence of all species of conservation concern. At the point-count scale, reedbed extent positively predicted species’ occurrence, but only in presence of patches of clear shallow water. Species-specific MARS models showed qualitatively similar results for some species, but generally were outperformed by multi-species ones. Multi-species MARS models confirmed to be an efficient tool in disclosing species-habitat relationships even for set of species including scarce taxa and when only short-term monitoring data are available. In terms of conservation measures, our findings stress the importance of Phragmites australis reedbed as a key habitat for avian biodiversity, but only when it is flooded and interspersed with scattered patches of open water. The preservation of wide (> 100/150 ha) and flooded reedbeds structured in spots of no less than 2 ha emerges as the main conservation measure for the long-term conservation of the threatened avifauna of inland pre-Alpine wetlands.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0154-9,avianres.biomedcentral.com,irania,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-5.96590729369012,,1085

Some uncertainty remained as to whether greylags wintering in Camargue, Southern France, belonged to this population and bred in Norway, Sweden and Finland, or rather originated from the Central European population, especially since most neck collar observations were of birds ringed in the Czech Republic. Stable hydrogen isotope (δ2H) analyses of feathers from 147 individuals hunted or trapped during winter in Camargue provide some insight into this question and suggest north-central Europe as a more likely area of origin. This indicates that greylags wintering along the Mediterranean coast may be largely separate from the birds of the NW/SW European population breeding in Fennoscandia, although some individuals may also come from the Polish or German regions of the NW/SW flyway, since the combined ringing and stable isotope analyses suggest these birds are mostly breeding and moulting in an isotopic area consistent with the Czech Republic, Poland and northern Germany. Earlier studies show birds wintering in other French regions rather originate from Sweden and Norway.

We hypothesised that widely reported negative effects of wind farms on predatory birds might benefit potential prey species. We focussed on reptiles due to concerns over worldwide declines in this group. We compared avian attack rates on clay model snakes at a site in Caithness UK within a wind farm relative to a control site of the same topography and habitat class, 1 km away, using life-sized clay models of adder Vipera berus, a widespread but declining Palaearctic species. Attack rates at the control site were comparable with similar studies elsewhere in Europe. However, we found that attack rates were lower within wind farm arrays, although several species of bird known to prey on reptiles were observed both within the wind farm and the control site. Therefore, given the high rate of loss to avian predators experienced in reptile reintroduction and reinforcement projects, wind farm sites may offer safe-havens, representing a neglected opportunity in reptile conservation. Grazing by sheep severely offset this benefit, presumably through removal of plant cover which was apparent in those areas of the wind farm where sheep were allowed access; grazing must thus be managed carefully for these benefits to be realised.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10344-020-01393-y.pdf,link.springer.com,geococcyx,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-5.981865702816126,,673

The aim of the current study was to investigate biotic and abiotic factors that may influence the population dynamics of this invasive parasite. To study the influence of vegetation zone and related climatic factors on fly numbers, a bi-weekly monitoring program using papaya-baited traps was carried out at a dry, lowland site and at a humid, highland site on Santa Cruz Island between 2012–2014. Female flies, a large proportion of which were inseminated and gravid, were collected throughout the year at both sites, indicating females were active during and between the bird breeding seasons. This is the first evidence that female flies are able to persist even when hosts are scarce. On the other hand, catch rates of male flies declined between bird breeding seasons. Overall, catch rates of P. downsi were higher in the drier, lowland habitat, which may be a consequence of host or resource availability. Time was a stronger predictor of adult fly numbers than climate, further suggesting that P. downsi does not appear to be limited by its environment, but rather by host availability. Seasonal catch rates suggested that populations in both habitats were continuous and multivoltine. Numbers of adult female flies appeared to be regulated chiefly by simple direct density dependence, and may be governed by availability of bird nests with nestlings. Nevertheless, confounding factors such as the existence of reservoir hosts that perpetuate fly populations and changes in behavior of P. downsi may increase the vulnerability of bird hosts that are already IUCN red-listed or in decline.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224125&type=printable,journals.plos.org,garzette,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-5.99240021344751,,915

In this paper, we aim to assess the role of climate matching, trade patterns and breeding origin as drivers of establishment success of introduced lovebirds (Agapornis species). A comprehensive database on the worldwide distribution of eight species of non-native lovebirds (including establishment success and population size from 21 countries spanning 27 years) was compiled. We combined climate-based species distribution models with environmental niche analyses to evaluate environmental suitability and potential niche shifts in the introduced range of lovebirds. Then, we tested whether combining habitat suitability with information on trade, introduction effort and breeding origin (captive-bred or wild-caught) of imported birds can improve model predictions at the country level. Although climate-based models fit well with the current distribution of non-native lovebirds at 5-arcminute resolution and significant niche similarity was found for 3 species, we also observed successful establishments in areas climatically distinct from those occupied in native ranges. At the country level, only a significant relationship between the number of established populations and both the number of introduction sites and the year of first importation was observed. A significant effect of breeding origin was not found, but most traded birds had a captive-bred origin. Our work contributes to the growing evidence of the complexity of the invasion process and the difficulty of pre-introduction invasion assessments based solely on the characteristics of the recipient environments for the Agapornis species. Surveillance protocols should be applied to both wild-caught and captive-bred lovebirds, as additional data becomes available to better tease apart the role of origin in those species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10530-019-02100-y.pdf,link.springer.com,lovebird,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-5.99956404264926,,930

To enhance our understanding of marine habitat use by the highly pelagic Bermuda petrel Pterodroma cahow, we deployed GPS tags on 6 chick-rearing adults in April 2019 and constructed a habitat suitability model using locations classified as foraging to explore functional responses to a selection of marine environmental variables. We defined 15 trips for 5 individuals, ranging from 1-6 trips per bird, that included both short and long foraging excursions indicative of a dual foraging strategy that optimizes chick feeding and self maintenance. The maximum distance birds flew from Bermuda during foraging trips ranged from 61 to 2513 km (total trip lengths: 186-14051 km). Behaviourally deduced foraging habitat was best predicted at shorter distances from the colony, under warmer sea surface temperature, greater sea surface height, and in deeper water compared to transiting locations; our model results indicated that suitable foraging habitat exists beyond the core home range of the population, as far north as the highly productive Gulf Stream frontal system, and within the territorial waters of both the USA and Canada.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the ecological and conservation status of the two species by: i) verifying their presence in the field; (ii) determining the current ecological and conservation status through an IUCN Red List Assessment; and (iii) identifying potentially suitable habitat by using the Species Distribution Model (SDM) as a tool to support Red List assessment. Extensive field surveys were carried out from March to September 2017 to determine the target species distribution, population characteristics, habitat, ecology, and threats. The results of these surveys provided great news, the two species were recorded in 14 sites, most of which are not historic (ten sites for M. serbaliana and five sites for V. kaiseri), in a very small restricted area of high mountains. The Extent of Occurrence (EOO) was 65.8 km2 for M. serbaliana and 108.4 km2 for V. kaiseri. The population sizes were very small, scattered, and fragmented. SDMs found that the potential suitable habitats for both species are concentrated in high mountain areas in the Middle North part of SCPA. A total of 20.4 km2 were predicted to have a high probability that M. serbaliana is present, whereas 68.6 km2 were predicted to have a high probability that V. kaiseri is present. SDMs were highly efficient in predicting the suitable habitat and in estimating EOO, and these models were therefore able to contribute to determining the extinction risk of the two species. Based on the assessed distributions and threats to the populations of M. serbaliana and V. kaiseri, we predict that both species have an Endangered status according to IUCN Red List Categories and criteria. Many threats have been detected that have a strong and noticeable impact on the target plants in the field, such as grazing and drought, and this calls for the establishment of an urgent conservation program.

We surveyed local habitat characteristics, breeding bird presence, abundance and foraging activity in 47 grassland sites, distributed along an urban-rural gradient in two French cities, and varying in the proportions of grassland, built-up land and residential gardens in the neighbouring landscape. Species richness was influenced by local rather than landscape variables; larger sites with scrub within the grassland and taller hedgerow vegetation were more species rich. Total bird abundance, however, depended on landscape context, and increased in suburban grasslands with a higher proportion of gardens in the landscape. Foraging in grass was more frequently observed in shorter, regularly mown, recreational grasslands. These were more common in urban contexts and favoured by species requiring easily accessible and visible invertebrate prey. Less intensively managed wastelands were species rich despite being in urban contexts and favoured by seedeaters and one farmland specialist.

In this study, we performed bird surveys in 30 orchards for two years to investigate how abundance, species richness and evenness in wintering bird communities were affected by the availability of unharvested fruits in pome fruit orchards and of fruiting ivy in surrounding hedgerows. We further investigated how these resources depend on orchard management. We observed 41 bird species overall, among which 13 were of conservation concern. Bird abundance was mainly driven by the number of unharvested fruits and to a lesser extent by the number of ivy bearing trees.

We remain ignorant about the biogeographical subpopulation structure of the species and potential differences in their migration timing, stopovers and schedules, information that could be vital to effective conservation of different elements of the species population, which we address here with results from a telemetry study. In 2017–2018, we attached GPS/GSM telemetry devices to 238 Swan Geese on moulting sites in three discrete parts of their summering area (Dauria International Protected Area, Central Mongolia and Western Mongolia), generating 104 complete spring and autumn migration episodes to compare migration speed and nature between birds of different summer provenances. Birds from all three breeding areas used almost completely separate migration routes to winter sympatrically in the Yangtze River floodplain. Although many features of the spring and autumn migrations of the three groups were similar, despite the significantly longer migration routes taken by Western Mongolian tagged birds, birds from Dauria Region arrived significantly later in winter due to prolonged staging in coastal areas and took longer to reach their breeding areas in spring. Among birds of all breeding provenances, spring migration was approximately twice as fast as autumn migration. Areas used by staging Swan Geese (mainly wetlands) in autumn and spring almost never fell within national level protected areas, suggesting major site safeguard is necessary to protect these critical areas. This study showed the discreteness of migration routes taken by birds of different summer provenances and differences in their migratory patterns, highlighting key staging areas (Yalu River Estuary in China/North Korea for Dauria Region breeding birds, Daihai Lake for Central Mongolian and Ordos Basin for Western Mongolian birds).

Its wide distribution, the complexity of international monitoring due to its capacity for long-distance flying, and a focus mostly on local populations, make it difficult to understand the dynamics between sites. Here, we took advantage of the citizen eBird science project to present a global perspective on the distribution of the American Flamingo, and identify the potentially most important countries for breeding. We obtained 16,930 records for the Americas from the 1960s until October 2018, of which 9,283 could be used for our objectives. The eBird database indicated a considerable increase in the total number of records over the last decade (2010s), probably reflecting an increase in tourism facilities, research investment, technological advancement, interest in conservation, and the worldwide availability of eBird. We also observed a range extension in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States and a significant recolonization in the Florida Peninsula. The apparent range extension to the South is more likely to be linked to biases in the data; for example, in any given country the number of records might reflect either reporting efforts or actual numbers. eBird data confirmed that six countries host the main breeding colonies (Bahamas, Bonaire, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, and Venezuela). We suggest three additional countries as potential breeding areas for the species (Colombia, Curaçao, Turks and Caicos Islands) for which more field observations are necessary to support this possibility.

South Korea lacks endemic bird species, and is rather poor in terms of avian dry land diversity compared with other East Asian countries, but its wetlands and waterways are extremely important for the future conservation of migratory waterbird species, around 13 of which are globally threatened, and for the future well-being of the human population. Its extensive tidal-flats support three charismatic and threatened near-endemic breeding species (Saunders's Gull Larus saundersi, Chinese Egret Egretta eulophotes, and Black-faced Spoonbill Platelea minor) and a very significant percentage of the East Asian Australasian Flyways shorebirds. Rivers, reclamation lakes and rice-fields support more than 1 million migrant and overwintering waterbirds, including most of the world's Baikal Teal Anas formosa, White-naped Grus vipio and Hooded Cranes Grus monacha. Amongst East Asian countries it has one of the richest economies and one of the strongest environmental movements too, boding well for long-term conservation. Yet, presumably as it lacks an international NGO and has not yet received much interest from foreign birders, South Korea still remains something of a relative unknown to the worlds conservation and birding communities. This article therefore aims to highlight the importance of Korea's wetlands for migratory bird populations, and give additional information on threats and conservation initiatives. Geography and Climate South Korea forms the southern part of the north-south oriented Korean peninsula, lying broadly between 34 and 38 degrees North, and between 126 and 130 degrees East. It is surrounded by sea on three sides, with the Yellow Sea to the west (bordered by China, North Korea and South Korea, this semi-enclosed shallow sea has an average depth across the whole of only 44 m), the South Sea or Tsushima Strait to the south, and the deep East Sea (or Sea of Japan) to the east. Due to these seas ameliorating effects, South Korea has elements of both continental and maritime-temperate climates. Winters are generally dry and cold with periods of prolonged subzero temperatures in the north, especially away from the coast, but often milder, wetter conditions in the south, leading to inland rivers freezing in the north but largely unfrozen tidal-flats and coastal reclamation lakes in the southwest and southeast (determining the mid-winter distribution of species such as Saunders's Gull and Baikal Teal). Summers are generally hot and humid (with daily maxima typically above 30°C in the warmest areas), and the heaviest rains usually fall between June and September, either as part of summer monsoons or carried by typhoons. Drought conditions are reasonably frequent, further stretching very limited water resources. Wetlands There are two broad categories of wetland supporting significant concentrations of waterbird in South Korea and the food needs of much of the human population: intertidal/tidal and freshwater. Both should be considered global conservation priorities. As of 1998, tidal-flats covered approximately 280,000 ha (with most unvegetated, and only small areas supporting Suaeda saltmarsh), while the six major flood-plain/coastal plain areas nationwide (five in the west, one in the southeast) now contain most of the freshwater waterbird habitat.",,orientalbirdclub.org,baikal,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.07146133677915,"['grus vipio', 'baikal teal', 'anas formosa', 'grus monacha', 'egretta eulophotes', 'larus saundersi', 'spoonbill', 'chinese egret']",1000

In particular, the acknowledged role of synthetic pesticides on direct bird intoxication or food resource depletion urges us to seek alternative crop protection methods. Pest exclusion netting systems have recently gained popularity among fruit growers as an efficient means of reducing pest attacks, allowing their transition to organic farming. Single-row exclusion nets, which only cover fruit trees and leave uncovered both the inter-row grassy strips and the hedges, are increasingly being used in apple orchards of Southern Europe. However, net-induced effects on wildlife remain unknown. This study is the first to assess the impacts of single-row exclusion nets on breeding bird communities. We hypothesized that the exclusion net effects would be weaker than those associated with synthetic pesticide use, except for bird species that forage in the tree canopy. We monitored breeding bird abundance, and species richness in 46 commercial apple orchards managed using integrated pest management (IPM) or organic standards with or without exclusion nets. We counted 705 birds belonging to 32 different species. Total bird abundance, the number of observed species, and the Chao1 estimate of species richness were influenced by orchard management strategy. Breeding bird assemblages in organic orchards were as numerous and diverse in both the presence and absence of exclusion nets. In contrast, both bird abundance and species richness were significantly decreased in IPM orchards. The abundance and species richness of bird assemblages and the abundance of a few individual species also increased with the number of hedgerows bordering the orchards. Our results demonstrate that single-row netting systems for organic farming represent an effective pest control strategy with no significant impact on bird communities and highlight the importance of hedgerows along the orchards’ edges.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13593-021-00743-7.pdf,link.springer.com,bouvier,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.07791329121845,,37

The periods of occurrence of yellow young were highly overlapped with those of eggs. More developed young with downy plumage were found throughout the year. Young with plumage similar to that of adults (juveniles) were eventually found. Records accompanied by comments provided by citizens indicated that nests and young are cared by both parents.

However, landfills often contain multiple habitat types that could attract diverse species, including those of conservation concern. To date, little is known about the characteristics and composition of bird communities at landfills relative to local and regional pools. Here we used the community science database eBird to extract avian species occurrence data at landfills across the US. We compared species richness and community similarity across space in comparison to similarly-sampled reference sites, and further quantified taxonomic and dietary traits of bird communities at landfills. While landfills harbored marginally lower species richness than reference sites (respective medians of 144 vs 160), landfill community composition, and its turnover across space, were similar to reference sites. Consistent with active waste disposal areas attracting birds, species feeding at higher trophic levels, especially gulls, were more frequently observed at landfills than reference sites. However, habitat specialists including two declining grassland species, Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), as well as migratory waterfowl, were more frequently encountered at landfills than reference sites. Together, these results suggest that landfills harbor comparable avian diversity to neighboring sites, and that habitats contained within landfill sites can support species of conservation concern.

Range discontinuity can reduce or cut off gene flow to small peripheral populations and lead to genetic drift and subsequent loss of genetic diversity. The southern extent of the Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa) range in North America is discontinuous, unlike their northern core range across the boreal forests. We sampled owls from five different locations on the periphery of the range across the western US (Wyoming, Idaho, California, northern Oregon, and southern Oregon) to investigate genetic population structure and genetic diversity. Using a reduced-representation genomic sequencing approach to genotype 123 individuals at 4817 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, we identified four genetically differentiated populations: California, southern Oregon, northern Oregon, and Wyoming and Idaho grouped together as a single Rocky Mountain population. The four genetically differentiated populations of Great Gray Owls identified in this study display high differentiation and low genetic variation, which is suggestive of long-term isolation and lack of connectivity, potentially caused by range discontinuity. The populations that lack habitat connectivity to the rest of the breeding range (i.e. those in California and Oregon) had lower genetic diversity than the Rocky Mountain population that is connected to the core of the range. These factors and other risks (such as disease and human-caused mortality) heighten susceptibility of these range-edge populations to future habitat and climate changes, genetic diversity erosion, and potential extinction vortex.

We used radio-telemetry to describe spatial behaviour of the critically endangered, island-endemic Mariana Crow Corvus kubaryi. To determine whether management strategies should reflect life stage, we measured the home ranges and daily movements of 22 Mariana Crows. Fledgling mobility was low during the first 31 days post-fledging and effects of age (fledgling or sub-adult) and time (months post-fledging or post-dispersal) were often driven entirely by this period. After controlling for reduced fledgling mobility, cumulative home range size increased over time for both age classes and was, on average, more than twice the area for sub-adults than fledglings. Sub-adults also tended to make longer daily movements than fledglings. Non-cumulative, monthly home range areas did not increase over time but the average overlap in home range area between consecutive months was only 63%, suggesting large shifts in space use each month. These results highlight the dynamic nature of Mariana Crow home ranges and suggest that large-scale management efforts are critical for protecting both breeding and non-breeding individuals.

We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002–2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002–2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year).

Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species.

However, the topographic complexity of mountain areas could create microclimatic refuges which may alter species distributions at small spatial scales. To assess whether fine-scale data (temperature and/or topography) improve model performance when predicting species occurrence, we collected data on presence–absence of bird species, habitat and fine-scale temperature at survey points along an elevational gradient in the Alps (NW Italy). Large-scale temperature data, and both large- and fine-scale topography data, were extracted from online databases for each point. We compared species models (fine-scale vs large-scale) using an information-theoretic approach. Models including fine-scale temperature estimates performed better than corresponding large-scale models for all open habitat species, whereas most forest/ecotone species showed no difference between the two scales.

First-generation biofuel crops contain oil, sugar or starch and are usually also grown for food, whereas second-generation biofuel is derived from non-food sources, including lignocellulosic crops, fast-growing trees, crop residues and waste. Biofuel production drives land-use change, a major cause of biodiversity loss, but there is limited knowledge of how different biofuel crops affect local biodiversity. Therefore, a more detailed understanding could inform more environmentally-conscious decisions about where to grow which biofuel crops. We synthesised data from 116 sources where a potential biofuel crop was grown and estimated how two measures of local biodiversity, species richness and total abundance, responded to different crops. Local species richness and abundance were 37% and 49% lower at sites planted with first-generation biofuel crops than in sites with primary vegetation. Soybean, wheat, maize and oil palm had the worst effects; the worst affected regions were Asia and Central and South America; and plant species richness and vertebrate abundance were the worst affected biodiversity measures. Second-generation biofuels had smaller, but still significant, effects: species richness and abundance were 19% and 25%, respectively, lower in such sites than in primary vegetation.

The north-east of the Indian subcontinent lies at the crossroads of the Oriental Region. Tropical semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests in the lowlands extend from here south and west into the subcontinent, and east into southern China and South-East Asia. Subtropical forests follow the foothills of the Himalayas to the west and extend into south-east China and northern South-East Asia to the east. In the plains of Assam, the wetlands and grasslands support a distinct group of birds, many of which range to the Gangetic plain in the west and the wetlands and grasslands of South-East Asia in the east. Himalayan temperate and subalpine zone forests extend from northern Pakistan and adjacent Afghanistan through north-east India to south-west China, and at high altitudes alpine habitats support many birds characteristic of the mountains of central Asia. This wealth of habitats is reflected in a wealth of birds, and this area probably supports the highest diversity of bird species in the Orient. It also has one of the largest concentrations of globally threatened birds in Asia. The principal threat is habitat loss, particularly of wetlands and grasslands on the plains, tropical lowland forests, and subtropical and temperate forests in the Himalayas. However, the conservation situation is far from clear. Regional workshops for South Asia and South-East Asia held during 1995 as part of the Asian Red Data Book Project (Bull. OBC, 21: 64) revealed that there is a general lack of information on the current status of both the birds and their habitats. The eastern Himalayas have a distinctly different climate (and hence vegetation and avifauna) to the rest of the range, as they lie further to the south and have warmer mean temperatures and fewer days with frost, and generally have a much higher rainfall (12). They extend from the Arun-Kosi valley in eastern Nepal, through Bhutan, north-east India, south-east Tibet and northern Myanmar to north-west Yunnan in China, and are here taken to include the mountains which extend from Nagaland and Manipur in India south to the Chin Hills in Myanmar and the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh. These mountains have been identified as an endemic bird area by BirdLife International (4,16), which supports 22 restricted-range bird species of which 19 are eastern Himalayan endemics. There is considerable variation in ornithological coverage within the eastern Himalayas. Eastern Nepal (5) and Darjeeling (see OBC's Indian Birding Itineries) are relatively accessible and well known to birders. A major ornithological survey of Bhutan was carried out by Salim Ali and colleagues between 1966 and 1973 (although their full report has yet to be published, 1), and several subsequent studies have been carried out (3,6,7). Far less information is available from the large, mountainous Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where recent surveys have been carried out in Namdapha National Park (13) and other sites in the east of the state (8), and the observations of Pratap Singh from localities throughout the state are particularly important (14). There appears to have been little recent work on birds in the Indian states of Manipur and Nagaland, and most of Burma (Myanmar) has until recently been inaccessible to birders, although the changing situation there has allowed visits to Mount Victoria and elsewhere (Bull. OBC, 21: 72, 22: 57-59). There also appears to be little recent published information on Himalayan birds in south-east Tibet, but the work of the Kunming Institute of Zoology and others in the Gaoligongshan region of Yunnan has resulted in important new information (9,11).",,orientalbirdclub.org,d'orient,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.11382556621161,,1000

Migration has evolved to tackle temporal changes in availability of resources. Climate change has been shown to affect the 
migration dates of species, which raises the question of whether the variation in the timing of migration is climate or resource 
dependent? The relative importance of temperature and availability of food as drivers of migration behaviour during both 
spring and autumn seasons has been poorly studied. Here, we investigated these patterns in frugivorous and granivorous birds 
(hereafter frugivorous) that are assumed to postpone their autumn migration when there is plenty of food available, which 
may also advance upcoming spring migration. On the other hand, especially spring migration dates have been negatively 
connected with increasing temperatures. We tested whether the autumn and spring migration dates of eleven common frugivo-
rous birds depended on the crop size of trees or ambient temperatures using 29 years of data in Finland. The increased crop 
sizes of trees delayed autumn migration dates; whereas, autumn temperature did not show a significant connection. We also 
observed a temporal trend towards later departure. Increasing temperature and crop sizes advanced spring arrival dates. Our 
results support the hypothesis that the timing of autumn migration in the frugivorous birds depends on the availability of food 
and is weakly connected with the variation in temperature. Importantly, crop size can have carry-over effects and affect the 
timing of spring arrival possibly because birds have overwintered closer to the breeding grounds after an abundant crop year.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00442-020-04726-5.pdf,link.springer.com,piha,2022-04-12,0,1,1,1,1,-6.12777050200457,,622

As habitats and climate change due to anthropogenic activities, there is a need to develop species distribution models that can quantify these complex range dynamics. In this paper, we develop a dynamic occupancy model that uses a spatial generalized additive model to estimate non-linear spatial variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates. The model is flexible and can accommodate data from a range of sampling designs that provide information about both occupancy and detection probability. Output from the model can be used to create distribution maps and to estimate indices of temporal range dynamics.

To conserve small and fragmented populations, we need an understanding of their population dynamics. With a global
population estimate of < 120,000, Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is considered one of the Nearctic-Neotropical migrants at
greatest risk of extinction. This range-restricted songbird breeds in high-elevation fir (Abies balsamea) forests of the northeastern
United States and eastern Canada, and primarily overwinters in forests of the Dominican Republic. The Conservation Action Plan
for Bicknell’s Thrush identifies numerous actions that may help stem population declines and promote recovery of the species, yet the
empirical data needed to prioritize among these actions are lacking. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber models with mark-recapture data to
test a series of hypotheses about the factors that limit apparent survival in 178 adult Bicknell’'s Thrush (50 females and 128 males)
captured on the breeding grounds in Vermont (June-July, 2001-2015). We focused on putatively important factors from throughout
their annual cycle: cyclical population dynamics of nest predators, and weather effects on food abundance on the breeding and wintering
grounds. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was relatively stable (mean Φ = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.68) over our 15-year study, and
most strongly associated with fir mast production. Apparent survival was higher following years during which fir trees produced large
mast crops (mean Φ = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79), compared to following nonmast years (Φ = 0.56 ± 0.06, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68). These
results are likely driven by the reduced red squirrel density and increased nesting success and site fidelity of adult thrushes following
nonmast years. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was also associated with relatively wet conditions on the wintering grounds in
Hispaniola as assessed via the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation index (ESPI). These relatively wet December-March
periods are likely linked to greater primary productivity and the local availability of fruits and arthropods consumed by Bicknell’s
Thrush. Our research provides the most comprehensive examination of potentially limiting factors on Bicknell’s Thrush populations
to date and suggests future avenues of research exploring the relationship between food availability, survival, and climate change induced
reductions in rainfall for the Greater Antilles.",https://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art16/ACE-ECO-2019-1462.pdf,ace-eco.org,dominicaine,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-6.13191937353081,['catharus bicknelli'],884

Such information is critical from the conservation perspective and necessary for understanding the annual cycle. Studies are especially needed to identify key stopover sites in remote regions. Using satellite transmitters, we traced spring and autumn migration routes and connectivity of Grey Plovers on the East Atlantic Flyway. Our findings also revealed the timing, flight speed, and duration of migrations.
 We used ARGOS satellite transmitters to track migration routes of 11 Grey Plovers that were captured at the German Wadden Sea where they had stopped during migration. Birds were monitored for up to 3 years, 2011‒2014. Monitoring signals indicated breeding grounds in the Taimyr and Yamal regions; important staging sites on the coasts of the southern Pechora Sea and the Kara Sea; and wintering areas that ranged from NW-Ireland to Guinea Bissau. The average distance traveled from wintering grounds to breeding grounds was 5534 km. Migration duration varied between 42 and 152 days; during this period birds spent about 95% of the time at staging sites. In spring most plovers crossed inland Eastern Europe, whereas in autumn most followed the coastline. Almost all of the birds departed during favorable wind conditions within just 4 days (27‒30 May) on northward migration from the Wadden Sea. In spring birds migrated significantly faster between the Wadden Sea and the Arctic than on return migration in autumn (12 vs. 37 days), with shorter stopovers during the northward passage.

Comparing grazed and restored sites, we assessed the abundance and composition of tree functional types at different life stages (seedlings, saplings and adults), with focus on the region’s key palm species Attalea princeps (motacú). Additionally, we surveyed habitat structure and composition in the shrub and ground-layer, and monitored occurrence and encounter rates of large mammals and nocturnal birds along dusk and evening transects.

Mammal species richness was greater on the restored site, and there were more declining, globally threatened and site-unique species. Species richness was similar for nocturnal birds within forests on both the grazed and restored site, but nearly all species tended to be encountered more frequently on the restored site.

Across semi-natural grassland, heathland, bog and scrubland, Whinchat territories were characterised by higher Bracken Pteridium aquilinum cover, low density of trees and closer proximity to valley bottoms than paired unoccupied reference locations. Upland valleys may provide sheltered, warmer micro-climates, and wetter habitats in the bottom, that are potentially favourable for Whinchat.

Rural regions are globally experiencing change driven by diverse factors, including agricultural intensification, new agricultural commodities, residential development, and land abandonment. Understanding how different land-use trajectories affect biodiversity is critical for making informed decisions for the conservation of species in modified environments. We examined the impact of different land-uses on bird communities in the western Strzelecki Ranges, a formerly forested but now rural region in south-east Australia. We selected 25 study landscapes, each 1 km2, representing seven land-uses typical of rural regions: townships, lifestyle properties (low-density acreages or hobby farms), dairy farming, beef grazing, horticulture, tree plantation and natural forest. Terrestrial birds were systematically surveyed at 10 sites in each study landscape and the results pooled to represent the whole landscape. We recorded 80 native and 8 exotic species of birds, of which 46 species were classified a priori as forest species typical of the region. Different trajectories of land-use have generated variation in landscape structure, with a primary gradient of change from forest to rural townships. The composition of bird communities and the richness of four species-response groups showed marked differences across land-use types. The mean richness of forest species, for example, was greatest in natural forest land-use (30.0 species) and lowest in dairy farming land-use (14.5 species). Key lessons from this study include: (1) these diverse land-uses, typical of rural regions, are creating novel assemblages of birds that differ from that of the former forested environment; (2) land-use in this region is dynamic and so further re-assortment of bird communities can be expected through time; (3) despite such change, a component of the original forest avifauna persists, even in highly modified landscapes; and (4) each land-use type offers opportunities for nature conservation while also meeting the needs of people and agricultural production.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-019-01833-5.pdf,link.springer.com,wattlebird,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-6.1601304317561,['hobby'],974

An example of an affected ecosystem is the Scalesia forest, originally dominated by the endemic giant daisy tree Scalesia pedunculata (Asteraceae). The remnant patches of this unique forest are increasingly being invaded by introduced plants, mainly by Rubus niveus (blackberry, Rosaceae). To help large-scale restoration of this ecologically important forest, we seek to better understand the natural regeneration of S. pedunculata after invasive plant control. We monitored naturally recruited S. pedunculata saplings and young trees over five years in an area where invasive plant species are continuously being removed by manual means. We measured survival, height and growth of S. pedunculata saplings and young trees along permanent transects. Percent cover of surrounding plant species and of canopy shade directly above each S. pedunculata individual were determined, as well as distance to the next mature S. pedunculata tree. We identified potential factors influencing initial sapling survival and growth by applying generalized linear models. Results showed a rapid growth of saplings and young trees of up to 0.45 cm per day and a high mortality rate, as is typical for pioneer species like S. pedunculata. Sapling survival, growth and mortality seemed to be influenced by light availability, surrounding vegetation and distance to the next adult S. pedunculata tree. We concluded that natural regeneration of S. pedunculata was high only five months after the last herbicide application but that 95% of these recruits had died over the 5-year period. Further studies are needed to corroborate whether the number of surviving trees is sufficient to replace the aging adult trees and this way maintain remnants of the Scalesia forest. Urgent action is needed to help improve future restoration strategies to prevent further degradation of this rapidly shrinking threatened forest ecosystem.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0258467&type=printable,journals.plos.org,guayaquil,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.16658961463032,,189

In Kenya, some wetlands are more prominent and are recognized worldwide as tourist hot spots, biodiversity-rich zones and wildlife habitats. However, these wetlands face overexploitation and degradation from surrounding communities. The efforts to halt underlying threats and the projected declines in the size and quality of inland wetlands at local levels are not sufficient. The question guiding this study is as follows: to what extent do a Ramsar designation and formal and informal education support communities and institutional efforts in the protection of inland wetlands? This research was conducted at inland wetland lakes of Naivasha, Nakuru and Bogoria that have been designated as Ramsar sites to examine the extent to which existing education has influenced communities’ efforts in protecting wetlands. Primary data were collected via questionnaire from three study sites. Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, a logistic regression to determine the significance of various predictor variables, including education, for changes in biodiversity as a proxy for wetlands protection outcomes was performed. The results indicated that education, awareness and other key variables that were expected to support wetlands protection had no significant impact on changes in biodiversity. The study concludes that the designation as Ramsar Convention-protected status alone cannot stop the degradation of inland wetlands in an environment where existing formal and informal education has not empowered communities and institutional efforts.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10784-021-09534-7.pdf,link.springer.com,fish-eagle,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.1677812415681,,345

To overcome these limits, here we propose the collection of pellets under resting sites. Although requiring a large number of surveys to find suitable resting sites and obtain sufficient sample size, this method is minimally invasive and allows a precise estimate of the relative frequency of prey items per pellet and the assessment of kingfisher diet also outside the breeding period. The methodology was applied to an Italian kingfisher population (River Ticino, northern Italy) between March and October 2019. Resting sites were identified in 15 out of 54 sampling stations, from which 133 pellets were collected. By comparing diagnostic remains, 478 preyed individuals were identified including mainly fish (94.4%) ranging in total length between 21 and 105 mm. Fish availability of the River was assessed. The fish community included 49 species, of which 22 (45%) were non-native. Kingfishers preyed on the most widespread and abundant native species, while the contribution of exotic fish was lower than expected.

Its climatic, pedological, and geomorphological characteristics, together with the long geological isolation and inaccessibility, led to the flourishing of unique tree diversity, with great cultural and ecological value. Lately, trees on Socotra are facing new threats linked to the abandonment of traditional management practices, climate change impacts, and growing human pressure. This study assesses the relative influence of environmental factors and human activity as drivers of tree cover and density, which can be used to support land management policies for the conservation of this key local resource. Tree cover and density were assessed on a total of 3600 plots of 0.5 ha each, laid on a regular grid covering the entire area of the island through Collect Earth, a free open source software tool that allows an augmented visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite images. A total of 770,000 trees, with an average of 2.14 trees/ha, were estimated on the island. The collected data was validated by ground surveys in 26 plots. The relative influence of selected predictors (seven environmental, two anthropic) on tree cover and density was analyzed through logistic and survival regression. Tree cover and density were found to be impacted positively by steeper slopes, higher rainfall, and marked precipitation seasonality and negatively by relatively warmer temperatures and a higher sand content in the soil. Distance of each plot from the nearest road and settlement was calculated and neither of these anthropic predictors emerged as significant, indicating that the limited number of trees present are not currently as affected by anthropic pressure, but, instead, their presence is mostly limited by the harsh climatic and pedological factors. However, as human population and development increase, periods of drought rise, and extreme and random climatic events intensify, these additional stresses on the environment could negatively impact the availability of natural resources in the terrestrial environment. Lastly, potential recommendations to the existing conservation policies and Socotra Conservation Zoning Plan are discussed based on the results.

The effective conservation of birds requires knowledge of species-specific population dynamics. Yet these dynamics
during migration and across age and sex categories are poorly understood for small birds. The goal of this study was to assess large-
scale fall migration patterns of Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus). Because the age and sex categories of this species depart
from the breeding grounds and arrive from migration on different weeks, we predicted that each might use different migration routes,
differ in migration speeds, and vary in their weekly distributions. Rufous Hummingbirds are among a few declining species for which
a large amount of banding data is available during migration and across the migration corridor. We assembled a large hummingbird
capture dataset (28,948 captures; 459 unique locations; fall migrations from 1998 to 2013) and used the centroid location of each age-
sex-year-week group to calculate migration routes, timing, and speed. We used a utilization distribution kernel to measure distributions
during migration. Adult females tended to have a southbound migration route parallel and between those of young and adult males.
Moreover, a greater number of young birds migrated south through California in comparison to adult females and adult males. Our
results suggest that the migration of each age-sex category is separated by approximately two weeks with adult males migrating first,
followed by adult females, and then the young of both sexes; yet migration speed was not statistically different among categories. Last,
adult males were captured within a smaller geographic distribution, i.e., the area during any given week of migration, compared with
adult females and young. We conclude that different age-sex categories of Rufous Hummingbirds use alternative routes and differ in
migration phenology and distributions. Our results suggest that the age-sex categories could be affected differentially by habitat loss,
phenological changes, and climates during migration. Considering such demographic migratory dynamics could improve conservation
outcomes.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss2/art2/ACE-ECO-2020-1612.pdf,ace-eco.org,colibronce,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-6.17728351726805,['selasphorus rufus'],631

In building their nests, birds not only use plant stems, but also transport seeds attached to them. This may lead to dispersal of seeds from the parental population into heterogenic environments. In this study, we investigate the role of nests of the white stork as potential microsites for the establishment and growth of seeds contained in nest materials. From 27 white stork nests, we collected 313 specimens from 23 plant species. Numbers of individual specimens and values of plant species richness were significantly lower in nests occupied by storks than in unoccupied nests. The abandonment of nests promotes the succession of some plant species from seed banks contained in the nests, involving plant species different from those cultivated from the nest seed bank. It should be noted here that the specific physical environments of nests constitute the main factor in the development of a pool of specialised plant species in the nests, with the prevalence of ruderal species. These plants usually derive from local ruderal vegetation, which is abundant in agricultural landscapes. Our study showed that large birds created a microhabitat in their nests which was favourable to nest-mediated seed dispersal, as was the incidental accumulation of plant species as a seed bank in the nest. We show that seeds contained in the nests of large birds may germinate and grow, and that eventually fully-grown plants can produce seeds, especially barochorous plant species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11258-020-01109-x.pdf,link.springer.com,stork,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.1778315382912,['white stork'],473

Juvenile mortality is a primary threat to the persistence of the single remaining Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi) population, which is found on Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Therefore, variation in foraging behavior among fledglings, sub-adults and adults may highlight different needs or susceptibilities that could inform age-specific management strategies. During observations of 36 Mariana Crows, we found that of all food captures, 14% were plant-based, 56% were insects or their larvae and eggs and 30% were non-insect animal prey. Two food categories, fruits/seeds/plants and ants/termites/larvae, which were procured and processed with simple behaviors, were taken more frequently by fledglings. Crabs, which were processed using complex behaviors, were captured more frequently by adults. Adults acquired more food items from the ground than did fledglings and sub-adult birds, a result that was driven by the former’s high level of crab predation. We did not detect differences in foraging behavior between wet and dry seasons, suggesting that Mariana Crows maintain a similar diet year-round. Overall, our results highlight age-related differences in foraging behavior; however, future studies should identify whether these differences drive age-dependent variation in survivorship.

The comparison of our results with those of temperate forests of Canada and Chile reveals differences in the functional richness of birds in these habitats, with a lower impact of logging on functional traits.

Biased sex ratios can indicate differences in survival rates between sexes. In particular, differences in the sex ratios of fledged juveniles and adults can provide insight into the development of male bias among populations. In this study, we used data from individual birds captured over a 57-year period to assess the extent, and temporal variability in male bias in nine populations of ducks wintering in the United Kingdom: Gadwall (Mareca strepera), Northern Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Common Pochard (Aythya ferina), Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), Northern Shoveler (Spatula clypeata), Eurasian Teal (Anas crecca), Tufted Duck (Aythya fuligula), and Eurasian Wigeon (Mareca penelope). Overall, eight of these populations were significantly male-biased and adults were more male-biased than first-winter juveniles for all nine populations. The increased male bias among adults is consistent with the hypothesis that factors such as higher mortality of reproductive-age females during the breeding season is a major cause of male bias in duck populations. However, such predation cannot explain the male bias detected in first-winter juveniles in four of the populations. The temporal trends in male bias differed between adults and first-winter juveniles in Northern Mallard, Northern Pintail, Common Pochard, Common Shelduck, Eurasian Teal, Tufted Duck, and Eurasian Wigeon. Over the study period we found increased male bias among adult Northern Mallard, Northern Pintail, Common Pochard, Common Shelduck, and Tufted Duck as well as both adult and first-winter juvenile Northern Shoveler. We provide evidence that among wintering duck populations, sex ratios are typically male-biased, with adults exhibiting stronger male-biased sex ratios than first-winter juveniles.

Future projections suggested a significant expansion from the current range into northern parts of North America and Alaska, even under more optimistic climate change scenarios. Additionally, there is evidence of possible future colonization of islands in the Caribbean as well as coastal regions in eastern Central America. The most important bioclimatic variables for model predictions were Annual Mean Temperature, Temperature Seasonality, Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter and Annual Precipitation.

Objectives We used a Bayesian approach integrating capture-recapture data into an occupancy framework. We assessed the response of Darwin’s fox—a forest-specialist mesocarnivore—to habitat heterogeneity in landscapes with low and moderate fragmentation levels in Chiloé Island, Southern Chile. Our model accounted for differences in capture, occupancy and detection probability among individuals. Results We captured 33 Darwin’s foxes, totaling 65 captures/recaptures in 62 different traps (720 trap/nights). Foxes’ detection increased across years and females (n = 15; mean detection probability ± SE 0.07 ± 0.03) were less detected than males (n = 18; 0.11 ± 0.04). Mean [95% BCI] of Darwin’s fox occupancy ( $$\uppsi$$ ψ ) varied from 0.59 [0.43–0.75] in the landscape with the largest mean of forest patch size, to 0.24 [0.22–0.28] in the less heterogeneous landscape. Species occupancy decreased with distance from freshwater bodies. We also found a significant interaction between distance from freshwater bodies and total edges at landscape level, resulting in high occupancy values (> 0.5) in landscapes dominated by forest ecotones.

Electrocution drives the population dynamics of several threatened species of raptors, at local and global scales. Among the many solutions that have been tested to minimize this threat are supplemental perches; however, their efficiency has rarely been assessed. We designed 43 transects in 4 districts in mainland Portugal to gather data from birds perching on pylons with or without supplemental perches. From 2015 to 2018, transects were surveyed by car at least once. We analyzed the factors driving the use of these supplemental perches, and we analyzed if there were differences in the perceived risk (calculated from measurements and not from field surveys) depending on whether the perching was on pylons with or without supplemental perches. We recorded 548 perches of 14 species. Weather conditions seemed to play a role in birds’ choice of pylons with supplemental perches versus pylons without supplemental perches. Models also indicated a strong influence of observational conditions. The use of models showed us an important specific effect in the selection of supplemental perches where available: there are some species with a greater tendency to perch on supplemental perches, even when they use both pylons with and without supplemental perches. For most of the analyzed species and species groups, perceived risk was higher in pylons without supplemental perches compared to pylons with supplemental perches, but there were differences between species. Supplemental perches may be a useful and efficient tool for mitigating raptor electrocution. However, there are many influential factors affecting their success, and their effectiveness with different species groups is not homogeneous. Some studies show higher electrocution rates for certain species and devices and thus, their efficacy must be validated. We propose a two-step validation process, first in controlled conditions and then in the field.

Biodiversity can be described as taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. However, the effect of forest fragmentation on taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity is barely understood. We compare the response of taxonomic (species richness), phylogenetic and functional diversity of birds to forest fragmentation. We hypothesised that with increasing forest patch isolation and/or decreasing patch size the diversity of birds decreases but only if certain thresholds of fragmentation metrics are reached. Specifically, we hypothesized that out of the three diversity components the taxonomic diversity is the most sensitive to forest fragmentation, which means that it starts declining at larger patch size and higher connectivity values than phylogenetic and functional diversity do. We compared the three biodiversity metrics of central European bird species in a large set of forest patches located in an agricultural landscape. General additive modeling and segmented regression were used in analyses. Habitat fragmentation differentially affected studied biodiversity metrics. Bird taxonomic diversity was the most responsive towards changes in fragmentation. We observed an increase in taxonomic diversity with increasing patch area, which then stabilized after reaching certain patch size. Functional diversity turned out to be the least responsive to the fragmentation metrics and forest stand characteristics. It decreased linearly with the decreasing isolation of forest patches. Apart from the habitat fragmentation, bird taxonomic diversity but not phylogenetic diversity was positively associated with forest stand age. The lower share of dominant tree species, the highest taxonomic diversity was. While preserving a whole spectrum of forests (in terms of age, fragmentation and size) is important from the biodiversity perspective, forest bird species might need large, intact, old-growth forests.

We updated the French list of critical sites from the outdated 129 sites listed by the CSN to only 97, including 32 sites not previously detected by the CSN. We also showed that only one French critical site out of five benefits from the strongest category of protection over more than three-quarters of its area.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11252-020-01062-7.pdf,link.springer.com,toro,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-6.2140652381345,,571

With few exceptions, each breeding location supports at most one species from each of these groups. However, Gough Island supports two morphologically very similar, filter-feeding species: broad-billed P. vittata and MacGillivray’s prions P. macgillivrayi. To understand how these two species co-occur in sympatry, we compared the foraging ranges, habitat selectivity, trophic segregation and moult schedules of these species using combined geolocation-immersion loggers. After breeding, both species showed a well-defined westward migration prior to moulting. Moult lasted 11–19 weeks and was significantly longer in MacGillivray’s than broad-billed prions. Moulting birds occurred in specific areas within the Argentine Basin, with little overlap between the two species. Habitat analysis revealed species-specific preferences, in particular sea surface temperature. Activity patterns also differed; MacGillivray’s prions spent more time in flight, which indicates a more active foraging strategy, relying less on filter feeding. Stable isotope ratios (δ15N) in flight feathers were greater in MacGillivray’s prion, which is consistent with its less specialized bill morphology resulting in feeding at a higher trophic level. Inter-specific spatial segregation was observed for most of the tracking period, in large part because broad-billed prions breed roughly 3 months earlier than MacGillivray’s prions. At Tristan da Cunha, 250 km farther north, where only broad-billed prions breed, they departed, moulted and returned significantly later (15–17 days) than conspecifics from Gough Island, providing evidence for character displacement in sympatry with MacGillivray’s prion.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00227-020-3645-7.pdf,link.springer.com,prion,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.21557256216618,,778

We found that migration in spring (79 ± 12 days) took more than twice as long to cover the same distance as in autumn (35 ± 7 days). This difference in migration duration was mainly determined by significantly more time spent in spring (59 ± 16 days) than in autumn (23 ± 6 days) at significantly more stopover sites. We suggest that these geese, thought to be partial capital breeders, spent almost three quarters of total migration time at spring stopover sites to acquire energy stores for ultimate investment in reproduction, although we cannot reject the hypothesis that timing of the spring thaw also contributed to stopover duration. In autumn, they acquired necessary energy stores on the breeding grounds sufficient to reach Northeast China staging areas almost without stop, which reduced stopover times in autumn and resulted in the faster autumn migration than spring.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0157-6,avianres.biomedcentral.com,gosling,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.22451346126048,['anser albifrons'],1062

biodiversity by providing a range of habitat patches with different fire histories, habitat qualities, and vegetation
ages at a given scale. We investigated the response of avian fauna to fire, particularly species richness and
community composition, in a landscape composed of a diversity of vegetation ages including long-unburned
refuges (age 26 years), compared with a landscape of uniform vegetation ages recovering from an extensive and
intense fire.
Results: There was no effect of heterogeneity in vegetation age on species richness at whole forest management
block (about 6000 ha), or local (2 ha) scales. There were different responses of particular species to vegetation age.
Nine species showed responses to vegetation age at local (2 ha) scales, which is presumably a surrogate for
availability of key resources and which changes over time. Australian Pipit (Anthus australis Vieillot, 1818) were
absent from swamp vegetation <3.5 years old, while Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus Shaw & Nodder, 1792)
were only found in forest vegetation <3.5 years old. Year-to-year changes in local assemblages were detected after
removing the effect of time since fire. There was no difference in effect of the two fire regimes on assemblage
composition or feeding-guild structure.
Conclusions: Mosaics of different vegetation ages had no net benefit for biodiversity, as measured by species
richness and assemblage composition, at the forest block management unit scale. Different responses to vegetation
age among bird species did not lead to increased bird richness at the scale of forest management block. A
potential advantage of mosaics in conservation of avian biodiversity is through preservation of patches of older
vegetation ages in the landscape, compared to the periodic extensive loss of older vegetation ages in wildfires.
However, the absence of large-scale effects of vegetation age on bird species richness, the tendency for birds to
specialize to fuel ages >5.5 years in the landscape studied, and indications of flexible responses of some species at
landscape scales allows some flexibility in fuel management strategies and the scale at which they are applied with
respect to avifauna.

The primary cause appears to be the ascent of invasive mosquitoes and Plasmodium relictum, the agent of avian malaria, into elevations formerly free of introduced malarial parasites and their vectors. Given that these declines in native bird populations appear to be continuing, last resort measures to save these species from extinction, such as conservation breeding, are being implemented. Using 200–1439 SNPs from across the genome, we assessed kinship among individuals, levels of genetic variation, and extent of population decline in wild birds of the two most critically endangered Kaua‘i endemic species, the ‘akikiki (Oreomystis bairdi) and ‘akeke‘e (Loxops caeruleirostris). We found relatively high genomic diversity within individuals and little evidence of spatial population genetic structure. Populations displayed genomic signatures of declining population size, but individual inbreeding coefficients were universally negative, likely indicating inbreeding avoidance. Diversity within the founding conservation breeding population largely mirrored that in the wild, indicating that genetic variation in the conservation breeding population is representative of the wild population and suggesting that the current breeding program captures existing variation. Thus, although existing genetic diversity is likely lower than in historical populations, contemporary variation has been retained through high gene flow and inbreeding avoidance. Nonetheless, current effective population size for both species was estimated at fewer than 20 individuals, highlighting the urgency of management actions to protect these species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10592-021-01382-x.pdf,link.springer.com,'anianiau,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.23050219068925,"['oreomystis bairdi', 'akikiki', 'loxops caeruleirostris']",316

Spatial prioritization of high quality habitat in agricultural landscapes is needed to protect grassland biodiversity. Within this context, we focused on European ground squirrel, a keystone species in steppe and salt steppe ecosystems. Using historical data and habitat field mapping, this study evaluates species distribution and site occupancy along the southern margin of the species range (Serbia) and identifies priority conservation zones in an intensively used landscape. Using gap analysis to evaluate changes in distribution over time and land protection status of the occupied area, we found that the regional species range has been constricted by 70%, and that 43% of mapped areas were outside of conservation networks. We also used a landscape structure model and multivariate analysis to identify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on occupancy. After mapping potential conservation zones with a buffer radius of 4.6 km—the scale with significant effects on occupancy—we identified 19 potential agro-ecological zones that cover the full range of mapped species habitats. The proposed agro-ecological zones differ in percentage of occupancy, which was found to increase with the overall landscape heterogeneity. This study contributes to the ongoing effort to broaden the understanding of the ecology and conservation of the European ground squirrel and the grasslands they rely on.

These countries, which are separated by the Strait of Gibraltar, are each occupied by a different subspecies (i.e. Streptopelia turtur turtur in Spain and S. t. arenicola in Morocco) that may be adapted to different environmental conditions.

The niches of both populations overlapped, suggesting the selection of similar environmental conditions in the two countries. However, the species occurred more frequently in Morocco than in Spain. To study the potential role of local effects on the observed differences in abundance, 494 sampling points were surveyed in four different sectors of Spain and Morocco. These additional counts indicated that, after controlling for the effect of local habitat structure and climate, the European turtle dove is more frequent in Morocco than in Spain.

The populations of many species of raptors that forage in agroecosystems have declined as agriculture has intensified.
Cover crops are a recent trend in areas of intensive row-crop agriculture in the Midwestern United States that could positively affect
raptors by increasing the abundance and distribution of raptor prey. We assessed the habitat use of two raptors, American Kestrel
(Falco sparverius) and Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and tested for use of areas near cover-cropped fields. We conducted 1184
km of roadside transects in 2018 and 2019 in west-central Indiana and recorded 191 detections of our focal species. We constructed
resource selection functions within a use-availability design to evaluate raptor habitat use with a series of weighted logistic regression
models. For each species, we fitted models at two scales (transect and landscape) and with two definitions of available points (completely
random and random subject to perch constraints). American Kestrels were strongly associated with cover-cropped agricultural fields.
Red-tailed Hawks were strongly associated with woodlots. Scale did not greatly affect the inclusion of habitat variables into top models
for either species. Random models identified potential perch sites, whereas constrained random models identified more subtle habitat
preferences not included in the random models. For American Kestrels, constrained models revealed reduced use of woodland perches
and increased use of perches near cover-cropped and conventional agricultural fields. For Red-tailed Hawks, constrained models
revealed habitat associations, particularly reduced use of utility lines and human development, that were absent or de-emphasized in
random models. Modeling resource selection with constrained random availability will work best for well-studied species with discrete,
easily mapped habitat features. If damage to commodity crops by rodents in cover-cropped fields is a concern, raptor management
should focus on kestrels and could include erection of artificial perches, nest boxes, and enhancement of permanent herbaceous habitats
for hunting.",https://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art1/ACE-ECO-2020-1719.pdf,ace-eco.org,crécerelle,2022-04-09,0,1,1,1,1,-6.24498705824421,"['buteo jamaicensis', 'falco sparverius', 'american kestrel']",462

Abstract
The currently-observed increase in human activity in the Arctic accelerates the negative impact on the environment as well as increases the risk of threats to mankind itself. This paper reviews and summarises a selection of studies on the interaction between humans and the environment in the Arctic coastal zone, which is impacted by a warming climate and associated geohazards. The paper presents a general description of human presence in the Arctic, identifies and describes the processes that are threatening the infrastructure, and the anthropogenic processes that have a negative impact on the Arctic. It considers the possible future economic opportunities, and presents the sustainable requirements for modern human activity in the Arctic. The paper demonstrates the urgent need to develop a common, Arctic-wide strategy based on sustainable development. The time has come to change human perception of the Arctic because, in the near future, it may be considered as a refuge for climate change refugees.

However, it is also considered a pest on many oceanic islands, even though its true abundance and ecological effects on different island habitats are poorly understood. We present data on rabbit abundance for the best-preserved habitats of the Canary Islands, Spain (National Parks), including ecosystems differing in climate, topography, plant species richness and composition. Three methods of assessing rabbit abundance from faecal pellet density are compared to ascertain the best method to compare highly distinct habitats. The Cleaning method was used during spring, summer, autumn and winter to check whether there were differences in pellet degradation among habitats that could prevent comparisons between them. Rabbit abundance is determined by complex interactions among abiotic and biotic factor. Despite differences in climate conditions, the results obtained for rabbit density with fast methods correlated well with the slow Cleaning method. The Circular method was the most useful to work with for extensive sampling in different habitats. The best models for explaining rabbit density for all habitat types combined included tree cover, abiotic and topographic and climatic variables. Thus, factors influencing rabbit density vary depending on habitat type with Macaronesian laurel forests being the ecosystem least likely to be invaded by rabbits.

Many species also sing on their wintering grounds, but the function of this behaviour remains unclear. One possible explanation, proposed by the song improvement hypothesis, is that the birds take advantage of this period to develop their singing skills for the next breeding season. If so, non-breeding songs should reflect features of an early phase in song development, characterized by high vocal plasticity. In our study, we tested this prediction by comparing songs of thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) recorded at two different breeding areas in Europe and one wintering area in Africa. While all songs from European localities had a typical structure characteristic of the study species, 89% of the songs recorded from Africa were highly variable, lacking such typical structure. We conducted further detailed analysis of breeding and winter songs that exhibited species-specific structure. First, we explored plasticity at the syllable level using a cross-correlation analysis, to obtain similarity scores as a measure of consistency. Second, we asked multiple human observers to quantify element variability. Our results showed significant differences in syllable consistency between breeding and wintering grounds, with more consistent delivery of syllables in the breeding areas. Likewise, element variability was substantially lower in the breeding populations. While both results fit the predictions of the song improvement hypothesis, more research is needed to elucidate the roles of singing on the wintering grounds. Significance statement Many migratory songbirds sing on their wintering grounds, outside the breeding period. While the role of singing during breeding has been broadly studied, our understanding of the function of winter singing remains limited. We analysed songs of the thrush nightingale, a migratory songbird with highly complex songs, comparing song structures recorded from breeding populations in Europe and an African wintering site. We demonstrate that males recorded at wintering locations sang songs with both significantly lower syllable consistency and higher element variability. Such characteristics are comparable to those observed during the sensorimotor phase of song development, previously described in other species. This pattern supports the song improvement hypothesis, suggesting that males singing on the wintering grounds may practice songs for the next breeding season. This study contributes to the understanding of the functions of songbird vocal behaviour out of the breeding context.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-019-2765-x.pdf,link.springer.com,nightingale-thrush,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-6.25540457017181,"['thrush nightingale', 'luscinia luscinia']",883

On Néba, we estimated the population at 44–58 individuals. This Island Thrush population is dependent on the coastal forest, the richest habitat for invertebrates. However, the coastal forest habitat has been degraded in quality and extent. The Island Thrush forages in the litter by removing leaves with its bill. Fruits (diameter &lt; 10 mm), picked from trees and swallowed whole, are also a significant component of its diet. Néba and Yandé are currently free of two nest predator species, the black rat Rattus rattus and the New Caledonian Crow Corvus moneduloides. On Néba, a low breeding success rate of 15.4% was found. To ensure conservation of these relict thrush populations, two actions at least should be implemented: setting up a biosecurity programme to keep islands free of black rats and increasing the area of coastal forest.

In topographically complex landscapes, montane species typically inhabit multiple mountainous regions, but are absent in intervening lowland environments. Here we report a comparative analysis of genome-wide DNA polymorphism data for population pairs from eighteen Indo-Pacific bird species from the Moluccan islands of Buru and Seram and from across the island of New Guinea. We test how barrier strength and relative elevational distribution predict population differentiation, rates of historical gene flow, and changes in effective population sizes through time. We find population differentiation to be consistently and positively correlated with barrier strength and a species’ altitudinal floor. Additionally, we find that Pleistocene climate oscillations have had a dramatic influence on the demographics of all species but were most pronounced in regions of smaller geographic area.

The main focus of bycatch studies has been on the impact of larger vessels, with few studies assessing the impact of artisanal fisheries. Moreover, bycatch studies are often limited to a small number of marine regions, and significant gaps still exist in our knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of seabird bycatch. Here we present a multi-approach method to accurately quantify seabird bycatch driven by small- and medium-sized fishing fleets operating in a high priority area for seabird conservation on the Portuguese mainland. Results of three mitigation measures to reduce seabird bycatch on fishing gear where seabird bycatch is most likely to occur were also tested: high contrast panels in bottom gillnets, black hooks in demersal longlines and a bird scaring device in purse seines. The efficacy, acceptance, and economic viability were tested for each mitigation measure. Sixty-seven individuals of seven seabird species were bycaught during 295 monitored fishing trips between 2015 and 2018. Bycatch occurred mainly in demersal longlines (0.07 birds fishing event-1), followed by purse seines (0.02 birds fishing event-1) and bottom gillnets (0.01 birds fishing event-1). Nevertheless, the bird scaring device caused birds to interact less with the vessel (the presence of gulls was reduced by 11%), thus decreasing the likelihood of bycatch. This device has proved to be low-cost (representing less than 5% income of a single day’s landings) and easy to implement, being also well accepted by purse seine fishermen. It was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of high contrast panels and black hooks, as no bycatch events were recorded during trials.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5966ED13D8D87669845413B94ED31190/S0959270920000489a.pdf/div-class-title-a-contribution-to-reducing-bycatch-in-a-high-priority-area-for-seabird-conservation-in-portugal-div.pdf,cambridge.org,gulosus,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-6.263136455365881,,583

The authors define four climate periods based on humidity in the region: the mid-18th century to the 1820s, the 1830s to the 1950s, the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, and the 1990s to the 2010s. For each period, the area features related to humidity and human economic activities, which are followed by altering life for plants and animals in the region, are described. It is proven that only the existence and patterns of aquatic and waterfront communities are directly dependent on the climatogenic factors. Most changes in wildlife of the other communities reflect the impact of regional economic activities representing different stages and types, while the climate variations only adjust them. The ravine forests that existed in lake depressions until the 19th century could ensure the presence of a ravine-woodland complex in the regional fauna. After clearing these forests, a part of the ravine-woodland species complex completely disappeared from the region, some part became synanthropes, while others, once extinct from the region, then recolonized with the occurrence of polydominant woody-shrub thickets in lake depressions and afforested plains. A shift from a steppe vegetation formation to a desert formation across the plain occurred because of overgrazing during the dry season. Therefore, some steppe animal species also became extinct in the region, while the desert animals occupied the niches left vacant. Plowing of the flatlands caused the occurrence of wildlife species using the arable fields in the region as feeding habitats. Anthropogenic activities of various kinds contributed to the arrival of the range-shifting species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1062359020100040.pdf,link.springer.com,smew,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.26335562454605,,460

It is known that nest construction is a plastic behaviour but the extent to which plasticity is observed in a single species with a wide geographical distribution is largely unknown. This study sought to better understand variation in nest size and composition across a very wide geographical area. The hypothesis suggested that location would affect size but not composition of nests of the European Pied Flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). Nests and reproductive data were collected from seventeen study sites, spread over 6° of latitude and 3.3° of longitude on the island of Great Britain. Dimensions of nests were measured before they were deconstructed to determine the masses and types materials used in the outer nest and the cup lining. Geographical variation was observed in base thickness of nests but not many other dimensions. Nests varied in composition but were mainly made of leaf, moss, bark, grass, root and fern. Moss was used more to the north and east of the study area compared with more leaf mass towards the south and west. The species of leaf and bark used in the nests varied between geographical locations. Additionally, the use of leaves or bark from a particular tree species did not reflect the incidence of the tree species in the immediate territory. This study showed that nest composition was affected by geographical location over a wide area. Variation between nests at each location was high and so it was concluded that differences in nest composition reflect individual selection of materials but evidence is such that it remains unclear whether this is deliberate to fulfil a specific role in the nest, or simply opportunistic with birds simply picking up materials with the appropriate characteristics as they find them outside their nestbox.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0156-7,avianres.biomedcentral.com,hawaiano,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.26837765248122,"['european pied flycatcher', 'ficedula hypoleuca']",1071

Whereas species richness was not influenced by landscape structure at the largest spatial scale of study, activity levels were shaped by changes in landscape composition and configuration, with different responses for forest and open-area foragers. Decreasing activity of forest foragers was the most evident response of bat diversity to landscape structure at different spatial scales.

Understanding the key factors affecting bird diversity in urbanized environment is crucial to the protection of biodiversity in urban ecosystems. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We also measured a number of park characteristics (area, isolation, shape index, environmental noise, distance to city center, and habitat diversity) that are commonly assumed to influence bird diversity. We then used the information-theoretic multi-model inference approach to determine which park characteristics had significant impacts on bird species richness. We found that park area, habitat diversity and the distance to city center were the best positive predictors of bird species richness in Nanjing urban parks. By contrast, park isolation, park shape and environmental noise had little or no influence on bird diversity.

We aimed at identifying the most important habitats for waterbirds at the Vourkari inlet during winter. Data about habitat use and availability were collected for 14 waterbird species and for seven habitat classes. Habitat selection (Manly’s selection ratio), overlap indices (Pianka’s niche overlap index) and null models were calculated. All the studied waterbird species selected available habitats nonrandomly. Shallow waters (0–2 m), were used by 13 waterbirds and selected by five waterbirds. Pools and channels were used and selected by 10 species. Mud was used by nine species and selected by six species. Mud with rocky substrate was used by nine species and selected by eight species. Medium (2–4 m) and deep (4–6 m) open water habitats were used by seven species and selected by four species. Halophytic vegetation was used by six species and selected by two species. Several habitats were selected by nationally important populations: mudflat habitats (i.e., mud, mud with rocky substrate and pools and channels) by Common Redshanks (Tringa totanus), halophytic vegetation by Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta), shallow waters by Common Shelducks (Tadorna tadorna) and medium and deep waters by Sandwich Terns (Thalasseus sandvicencis), whilst shallow waters and mudflat habitats were preferred by a possibly internationally important population of Mediterranean Gulls (Ichthyaetus melanocephalus). Although overlap in habitat use between species was generally low, null models indicated habitat sharing and a lack of competition. Waterbirds coexisted in the absence of competition for habitats at Vourkari, where they mostly used and preferred shallow water and mudflats.

We identified two main introduction periods: late nineteenth and late twentieth centuries. In 1997, the species trade started to be regulated, resulting in a reduction of the imported numbers during the following years. Thus, the recent increase of the distribution range may be mostly related with self-dispersion. There has apparently been a great introduction rate near large urban areas which resulted in a broad spread into adjacent forests. The relationship between climatic traits and leiothrix presence may be due to its feeding ecology, as it often forages in wet soil and is limited by the availability of fruits and invertebrates.

We explored a wide range of plausible scenarios relating to assumed demographic rates, geographic scope of the flyway and management objectives. λmax was estimated to lie between 1.551 and 1.869. Current levels of hunting along the western flyway are more than double the sustainable fraction (P) under all suitably conservative scenarios, and only fall below this threshold under the most restrictive assumptions.

However, it is unknown whether local associations with clearcuts translate to an effect of clearcut amount in the surrounding landscape on occupancy or abundance at local sites. This question is important because forest management decisions are made at landscape scales. Objectives We examined whether the amount of clearcut in the surrounding landscape influenced site occupancy of two threatened aerial insectivores, Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will. Both species nest in/near clearcuts at a local-scale. Methods We used acoustic recorders placed on edges of recent clearcuts (≤ 15 years old, n = 49 sites) to measure presence-absence. We estimated occupancy in relation to the proportion of clearcut and open wetland within the surrounding landscapes at spatial extents between 0.5 and 5.0 km. Results Occupancy of Eastern Whip-poor-will was not related to clearcut amount in the surrounding landscape at any scale. Common Nighthawk occupancy was lower in sites surrounded by landscapes with higher proportion of older (11–15 years old) clearcuts. Both species’ occupancy was higher in sites where the surrounding landscapes had higher proportions of open wetland. Conclusions Two possible mechanisms for our results include multi-scale selection of breeding sites or demographic responses to higher productivity in wetlands than clearcuts; both need further study.

Here, we used over 7 million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species’ migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species’ vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades. Citizen-science data on bird observations from eastern North America show that the timing of spring arrival of migratory birds is broadly correlated with fluctuations in vegetation green-up but that the varying sensitivity of different bird species to this phenological event is linked to their different migratory strategies.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01442-y.pdf,nature.com,mayor,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.30771238506424,,356

Tracking data showed no geographical overlap during the annual cycle in Eurasian Spoonbills marked in the two main summering areas.

Excluding the single Inner Mongolian bird, spring migration was significantly faster than autumn migration in the other two groups of birds. Eurasian Spoonbills mainly used water, wetland and grassland habitats in summer, but almost exclusively water in winter. Lack of protection of staging sites used by all the birds in spring and poor levels of protection throughout the annual cycle for western Mongolian birds (5–22%) gives considerable cause for concern, although sites used in other time by East Mongolian and Naoli River birds in the rest of their annual life cycle enjoyed good levels of protection (49–95%). These results revealed previously unknown relationships between summering and wintering areas, migration routes and stopover sites for Eurasian Spoonbills wintering in China, suggesting the existence of discrete biogeographical population units.

The aerial surveys covered the Bering, Chukchi, and East Siberian Seas and the eastern part of the Laptev Sea. Mammals are ecologically associated with open sea areas, sea ice, continental and island coasts, and mainland tundra. Wintering flocks of birds are formed by species of inland mountain streams; species that are common circumpolarly in the Holarctic tundra; and marine species of the continental and island coasts of the North Pacific and the Arctic Ocean, including high-latitude endemics. Seven species of mammals and 23 species of birds have been recorded. There are 22 bird species recorded exclusively in the Bering Sea (24% of the marine avifauna of the Russian Far East). In terms of the number of species represented (n = 9), the prevalence is held by auks, which are very characteristic of the avifauna of the subpolar marine areas of the Palaearctic. Mammals have been regularly recorded in both the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific research sector. The winter fauna of mammals in the seas of northeastern Russia, which is dominated in terms of the number of species by pinnipeds and cetaceans, makes up 23% of the total mammalian fauna of this region. In the Bering Sea, three areas of concentration of wintering birds have been identified: in the southeast of Chukotka, southeast of Cape Navarin, and south of the Island of St. Lawrence. The maximum density of the bird population (21.8 ind./km2) is in young ice and ice of primary formation—where there are many forage polynyas. The bird population of all types of ice is numerically dominated by fulmar and thin-billed and thick-billed guillemots. Most of the marine mammals are observed on the openings in the contact zones of different types of ice or in the ice openings of autumn formation. Clusters are formed by polar bears near the Wrangel Island, by beluga whales to the east and northeast of Cape Navarin, and by walruses to the south of it. The stability of winter spatial groups of walrus and polar bears in the Arctic Ocean, which annually demonstrated similar levels of abundance, has been established. Winter aerial surveys show that beluga whales and humpback whales are not found north of the Bering Strait, and polar bears are almost never found outside the Arctic Basin.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1995425521050127.pdf,link.springer.com,d'anadyr,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.31759754192998,['fulmar'],182

An evaluation from Patagonia,"Most studies about the impact of urbanization on bird assemblages are from the Northern Hemisphere and most previous research has reported that cities reduced bird species richness and favored the settlement of exotic bird species. However, most of these studies took place in large cities and few of them were focused on riparian environments. The aim of our study was to investigate how richness and abundance of riparian birds change along the urban-rural gradient of Esquel, a small city in Patagonia. We established two rural riparian sites upstream, two urban riparian sites and two rural riparian sites downstream, and set up six point counts in each site. We counted birds twice (once in November 2013 and January 2014) and sampled vegetation coverage at each point count location. We used GLMMs to analyze data. Bird species richness decreased from rural to urban sites while bird abundance increased. Omnivores thrived in the city whereas insectivores and insectivore-frugivores were abundant in rural sites. Birds species richness was associated with plant species richness, while abundances of insectivores and insectivore-frugivores birds were related to shrub coverage and foliage height diversity. Our study highlighted that small cities can modify bird communities in the same way as large cities, thus policies for conservation of birds should be created to coincide with urbanizations. We recommend planting native species in all urban green spaces and informing citizens about the benefits of this action.

The urban expansion involves alterations of urban landscapes, resulting in habitat loss and threatening biodiversity. Landscape attributes of urban areas are known to influence urban bird composition, but to what extent is still poorly understood. Thus, several urban areas in west Peninsular Malaysia with varying intensity of urbanisation were chosen to determine the effect of landscape attributes on bird communities. A total of 4936 individual birds from 20 species representing 14 families, were recorded throughout the observations, dominated by Corvidae (crows). Based on the functional groups, only garden birds and omnivory feeding guild showed a significant difference in their abundance among different urban sites. Omnivory was the most abundant feeding guild (80%), dominated by House crow (Corvus splendens). This study shows that species composition is not influenced by level of urban intensity, but by the landscape attributes of each urban area. Multiple Regression analysis indicated that water bodies and roads significantly predicted species richness of birds, whereas high vegetation cover, road, and open area significantly predicted bird abundance. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination indicated that urban birds are not selective of landscape attributes, unlike other bird groups.

To inform these interventions in the South African context and under the current climate change scenario, we tested for geographic patterns of alien woody species across the network of 1,453 PAs using three alien invasion indices – alien species abundance, invaded area ratio and alien species richness. Our analysis shows that, under current climate change scenario, none of the PAs would be effective in shielding against alien plants and PAs that are geographically close tend to share similar invasion patterns. In addition, PAs that are hotspots of alien species are also geographically clustered but these findings are biome-dependent. Our outlier analysis reveals not only an island of disproportionately rich PAs in alien species, but also identifies some alien-poor PAs.

We tested the role of detectability for population trend estimation in an open Mediterranean farmland context, which is a dynamic landscape likely to undergo yearly changes in detectability, by using data of 30 bird species over a nine-year study period. We evaluated species-specific population trends under the TRIM approach and hierarchical distance sampling models (hereafter HDS) that estimate true abundance by accounting for imperfect detection. When comparing both methods, 13 species presented differences in population trend estimates between TRIM and HDS models. Moreover, detectability was not constant across the bird community: observer and year affected detection, and these effects varied among species. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in bird monitoring programs to ensure reliable trend estimates, providing a first insight for an open farmland bird community.

Future climate-driven projections anticipated minimal range shifts in response to climate change.

For birds, urbanization is specifically related to survival, breeding success, and territory size. Understanding how different birds adjust territory size in response to urbanization is essential for their conservation in urban environments and to better understand why some species are lost and others persist under this condition. We evaluated the effect of urbanization on the territory size of an urban avoider species, White-eared Ground-Sparrow (Melozone leucotis), and an urban adapter species, House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), at five Costa Rican sites. We measured the size of 30 ground-sparrow and 28 wren territories using a total of 296 h of observation. We followed each individual for at least 1 h per day for at least 2 days of two consecutive years, and geo-referenced their locations. Territory size was estimated using the minimum convex polygon method. We measured the urban surfaces (roads, buildings, any other paved area, soccer fields, lawns, and gardens with short grass) within territories. Ground-sparrow territories were larger at the highly urbanized site than at the non-urbanized site. Wren territories were larger at the low urbanized site than at the highly urbanized site. We found a positive relationship between urban surface and territory size for the ground-sparrow, but not for the wren. Our results showed that not all birds adjust territory size in the same way in response to urbanization. We showed that urban avoiders probably need to defend larger territories in urban environments to find all the resources required to survive because urban environments may provide insufficient resources such as food or shelter. Urban adapters on the other hand defend smaller territories in urban environments because even small territories may provide sufficient resources.

In recent decades, Argentina has witnessed agricultural expansion and intensification affecting biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Within agroecosystems, the level of habitat quality is critical for birds, and may depend on vegetation structure, availability of invertebrate prey, and the use of pesticides. Although the relationship between vegetation structure and avian occurrence has been widely studied, to our knowledge, there are no studies that also incorporate prey availability throughout the cycle of soybean crops in Argentina. We estimated and predicted the effects of land cover and temporal variation on the occurrence of avian foraging guilds in Entre Ríos, Argentina, in order to guide management related to potential ecosystem services provided by birds. We also estimated temporal effects of vegetation structure and insecticides on the main arthropod orders consumed by birds to evaluate prey availability. We conducted bird and arthropod surveys for 2 years along transects located in 20 randomly selected soybean fields (N = 60) and their adjacent borders (N = 78) throughout the crop growing season, in four seasons. We estimated avian occupancy, accounting for imperfect detection, and arthropod counts fitting generalized linear mixed models. The number of native trees in field borders positively influenced the occurrence of most bird species, mainly insectivores. Granivore foliage gleaners, also were positively affected by grass height. Salliers and aerial foragers were weakly affected by distance to forest and native trees. In general, the availability of invertebrates to birds was highest during the third season. Arthropod counts in borders were greater during the last three crop stages than during the pre-sowing period. We found that with 10 to 15 native tree species in borders, coupled with a complex vegetation structure with shrubs and grasses, we could conserve a wide spectrum of insectivorous birds, and may contribute to the invertebrate pest control service. Vegetated field borders function as a refuge for arthropods, especially agriculturally beneficial taxa such as Hymenopterans.

This study examines (a) whether Bramblings participating in mass concentrations originate from different, or additional, breeding grounds compared with birds present in normal winters, and (b) how differential migration according to age and sex groups combines with irruptive migration and with congregations in mass roosts, i.e., whether the benefits from mass concentrations differ between age and sex groups. Wing biometry (wing length, lengths of outer primaries, and wing pointedness) did not vary geographically, as shown by museum skins, and was therefore not helpful to reveal differences in origin between birds of mass concentrations and normal winters. The extent of the post-juvenile moult was smaller in mass concentration birds and suggests that slightly later-born juveniles, i.e., born further east or north, participate in mass concentrations. Ringing recoveries could not demonstrate a difference in breeding range origin of Bramblings which participate in mass concentrations versus Bramblings in normal winters in Switzerland. However, this may be due to insufficient recoveries of ringed birds. A rough estimate suggests that the number of Bramblings migrating SW on a broad front across Europe could be sufficient to form mass concentrations of up to 10 million birds which are halted by a large area of beech mast. Across Europe, the proportion of juvenile males decreased towards south (i.e., with increasing migration distance) in autumn migrants and wintering birds, while adult females showed the opposite pattern, and adult males and juvenile females were intermediate. Mass concentrations in Switzerland were composed of significantly more adults, especially adult males, and fewer juveniles, particularly juvenile females, while the sex–age composition outside mass concentrations was similar to normal winters. Adults and females likely benefit from wintering further south where snow is less likely to cover food of this ground-feeding finch. On the other hand, the costs of migration are probably substantial in terms of direct costs or indirectly in terms of reaching the breeding grounds, so that juvenile males prefer to winter closer to the breeding area than adults. Feeding in large flocks in beech mast areas incurs the high risk of being cut off from this food by snowfall. Adult males are apparently best adapted to this risk, and hence predominate in mass concentrations.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01916-7.pdf,link.springer.com,brambling,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-6.34972365446545,"['brambling', 'fringilla montifringilla']",264

However, as seasonal conditions alter the distribution of resources across a landscape, they can change the priority of group members and require groups to adapt and respond collectively across changing contexts. Little is known about how stable group-living animals collectively modify their movement behaviour in response to environment changes, such as those induced by seasonality. Further, it remains unclear how environment-induced changes in group-level movement behaviours might scale up to affect population-level properties, such as a population’s footprint. Methods Here we studied the collective movement of each distinct social group in a population of vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), a largely terrestrial and non-territorial bird. We used high-resolution GPS tracking of group members over 22 months, combined with continuous time movement models, to capture how and where groups moved under varying conditions, driven by seasonality and drought. Results Groups used larger areas, travelled longer distances, and moved to new places more often during drier seasons, causing a three-fold increase in the area used at the population level when conditions turned to drought. By contrast, groups used smaller areas with more regular movements during wetter seasons. Conclusions The consistent changes in collective outcomes we observed in response to different environments raise questions about the role of collective behaviour in facilitating, or impeding, the capacity for individuals to respond to novel environmental conditions. As droughts will be occurring more often under climate change, some group living animals may have to respond to them by expressing dramatic shifts in their regular movement patterns. These shifts can have consequences on their ranging behaviours that can scale up to alter the footprints of animal populations.",https://link.springer.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40462-021-00271-9,link.springer.com,vulturine,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.35045819003523,"['vulturine guineafowl', 'acryllium vulturinum']",286

For each bird species, the nesting densities and average sizes of the bird individual nesting home range were estimated, and raster maps of spatial allocation (MSA) at the scale of the raster grid of 50 × 50 m were obtained. The degree of spatial conservatism (DSC) for each local population was inferred from the pairwise comparisons of the specific MSAs obtained at the same area (28 ha) in different years with the use of the Gamma rank correlation method. The statistical dependence of the population habitat area on DSC was demonstrated earlier (Cherenkov, 2017). The more habitat area is found within the trial plot, the less dependent (random) the individual spatial allocation within a population is observed in different years. Significant DSC estimates (p < 0.05) were obtained for 15 species, and their habitat areas and habitat saturation were found. The population status was inferred from the degree of habitat saturation. Average estimates of the degree of habitat saturation were close in migratory and nonmigratory species (49 and 45%, respectively). The Altai migratory birds wintering in Southeast Asia did not differ statistically in the degree of habitat saturation from those wintering in Southern Europe and North Africa. A comparison of avifauna status of the Altai and Baikal regions revealed substantial differences. In Altai the number of the most common migratory nesting species is almost twice as high, their average nesting density is four times higher, and habitat saturation is twice as high as in the birds of the Baikal region. The interregional differences in the degree of habitat saturation indicate that most of populations of the migratory species of the Baikal region are subject to twice as much intensive pressure of some factors limiting the population growth compared to the Altai populations. At the same time, there were no significant differences in the ecological population status of the nonmigratory species between these regions. Close estimates of the degree of habitat saturation in nonmigratory species in the Altai and Baikal regions support a suggestion that the integrate influence of factors limiting their population numbers is similar in both regions. Close estimates of the degree of habitat saturation and nesting density in the migratory and nonmigratory Altai species show that neither of the two strategies of surviving gives a pronounced advantage. The difference between the Altai and Baikal regions in the degree of habitat saturation in the migratory species is seemingly determined by the different mortality levels in the wintering areas and on the routes of migrations.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1995425520060062.pdf,link.springer.com,baikal,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.35119244129191,,483

Reporting rates for species in SABAP2 were used as a proxy for relative abundance. While the parakeet’s range and abundance increased significantly, only two species showed a significant reporting rate decline in areas of parakeet occurrence. These declines persisted across a wider area where parakeets were not found. Broader-scale Gauteng reporting rate trends, not replicated in the parakeet range, were noted for nine other species, suggesting that the changing avifaunal composition in the anthropogenically transformed Gauteng may instead be driven by habitat change.

The House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), native to Europe and Asia, has been introduced globally and is now one of the
most ubiquitous birds in the world. In North America, these invasive passerines compete with native species for nest cavities, which
are often limited. Because of the difficulties of extirpating an invasive species and the growing desire from the public to help in
conservation matters, we sought to test a potential technique for managing invasive cavity-nesting passerines that could be successfully
deployed by professionals and citizen scientists alike. Previous studies demonstrate that applying vegetable oil to eggs is a nontoxic
management technique often used to manage unwanted waterfowl. Further, egg oiling is a technique that is acceptable to a large segment
of the public. This study assesses the efficacy of applying vegetable oil for preventing House Sparrow eggs from hatching, reducing the
number of fledged young, prolonging incubation time, and delaying renesting attempts by the adults. We sprayed treatment clutches
once with approximately 0.8 ml of vegetable oil early in the developmental period and subsequently monitored nests every 3-4 days.
The application of vegetable oil to treated eggs was 100% effective at preventing hatching and, thus, preventing any offspring from
fledging. Furthermore, the adults in the treatment group incubated their eggs for nearly twice as long as the adults at control nests,
reducing their opportunity to produce more clutches later in the season. Given the availability, low cost, and effectiveness of applying
vegetable oil to eggs to prevent the reproductive output of invasive cavity-nesting passerines, we propose that this method can be easily
implemented by wildlife managers as well as trained nest box stewards.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art20/ACE-ECO-2019-1491.pdf,ace-eco.org,ringneck,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-6.36151392749794,"['passer domesticus', 'house sparrow']",843

The ecological value of regenerating second growth to forest-dwelling birds may largely depend on the age of the forest, associated vegetative structure, and when it is capable of sustaining avian demographics similar to those found in pristine forest. To determine the influence of second growth age on bird demography, we estimated the annual survival of six central Amazonian bird species residing in pristine forest, a single 100 and a single 10 ha forest fragment, taking into consideration age of the surrounding matrix (i.e. regenerating forest adjacent to each fragment) as an explanatory variable.

Conversely, Percnostola rufifrons, a gap-specialist, showed elevated survival in response to fragmentation followed by a decline after 5 years of regeneration. Lastly, facultative flocking and frugivore species (Glyphorynchus spirurus and Dixiphia pipra, respectively) showed no response to adjacent clearing and subsequent regeneration. Our results in association with previous studies confirm that the value of regenerating forest surrounding habitat patches is dependent on two factors: ecological guild of the species in question and second growth age.

In these ecosystems, the brevity of optimal breeding conditions means species must efficiently track spatiotemporal variations in resources in order to synchronise their reproductive effort with peaks in food availability. Understanding the details of prey-habitat associations and their seasonality in such ecosystems is thus key for deciphering species’ ecological niches and developing sound conservation action. However, the ecological requirements of high-alpine avifauna remain poorly documented. Furthermore, mountain ranges in the Old World are affected not only by profound alterations of climate, but also by changes in land-use, the interaction of which hampers both proper forecasting of species’ resilience to environmental change and delivery of evidence-based conservation guidance. Here, we investigate the prey-habitat associations of a high-alpine passerine, the White-winged Snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), by radio-tracking breeding adults in the Swiss Alps. In late spring and early summer, Snowfinches foraged preferentially next to invertebrate-rich, melting snow patches where Tipulidae larvae abound. Later, in mid-summer, they favoured flower-rich alpine meadows. When foraging, they always preferred short ground vegetation while avoiding rock and scree. Their pattern of foraging habitat selection reflects trade-offs between food abundance and accessibility, i.e. prey availability. The reliance of this passerine on a habitat mosaic where snow plays a major role questions its ability to cope with climate change due to future habitat loss and potential phenological mismatches.

Location: Brazilian Amazonia. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Birds, fishes, bats, ants, termites, butterflies, ferns + lycophytes, gingers and palms. We compiled a unique dataset of biotic and abiotic information from 822 plots spread over the Brazilian Amazon. We evaluated the effects of environment, geographic distance and dispersal barriers (rivers) on assemblage composition of animal and plant taxa using multivariate techniques and distance- and raw-data-based regression approaches. Environmental variables (soil/water), geographic distance, and rivers were associated with the distribution of most taxa. The wide and relatively old Amazon River tended to determine differences in community composition for most biological groups. Despite this association, environment and geographic distance were generally more important than rivers in explaining the changes in species composition. The results from multi-taxa comparisons suggest that variation in community composition in Amazonia reflects both dispersal limitation (isolation by distance or by large rivers) and the adaptation of species to local environmental conditions. Larger and older river barriers influenced the distribution of species. However, in general this effect is weaker than the effects of environmental gradients or geographical distance at broad scales in Amazonia, but the relative importance of each of these processes varies among biological groups.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-020-02040-3.pdf,link.springer.com,someren,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.37014591762091,,595

Visual predators such as corvids and egg-eating raptors, are among the most common causes of nest failure; thus, parental strategies that reduce the risk of visual nest predation should be favored by selection. To date, most research has focused on egg crypsis without considering adult crypsis, although in natural circumstances the eggs are covered by an incubating parent most of the time. Here we use a ground-nesting shorebird, the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) as model species to experimentally test whether decoy parents influence nest predation. Using artificial nests with a male decoy, a female decoy or no decoy, we found that the presence of a decoy increased nest predation (N = 107 nests, p < 0.001). However, no difference was found in predation rates between nests with a male versus female decoy (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found that nests in densely vegetated habitats experienced higher survival compared to nests placed in sparsely vegetated habitats. Nest camera images, predator tracks and marks left on eggs identified the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) as the main visual nest predator. Our study suggests that the presence of incubating parents may enhance nest detectability to visual predators. However, parents may reduce the predation risk by placing a nest in sites where they are covered by vegetation.

Despite a growing literature on bird-building collisions, little research has been conducted in downtown areas of major cities, and no studies have included stadiums, which can be extremely large, often have extensive glass surfaces and lighting, and therefore may cause many bird collisions. Further, few studies have assessed the role of nighttime lighting in increasing collisions, despite the often-cited importance of this factor, or considered collision correlates for different seasons and bird species. We conducted bird collision monitoring over four migration seasons at 21 buildings, including a large multi-use stadium, in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We used a rigorous survey methodology to quantify among-building variation in collisions and assess how building features (e.g., glass area, lighting, vegetation) influence total collision fatalities, fatalities for separate seasons and species, and numbers of species colliding. Four buildings, including the stadium, caused a high proportion of all collisions and drove positive effects of glass area and amount of surrounding vegetation on most collision variables. Excluding these buildings from analyses resulted in slightly different collision predictors, suggesting that factors leading some buildings to cause high numbers of collisions are not the exact same factors causing variation among more typical buildings. We also found variation in collision correlates between spring and fall migration and among bird species, that factors influencing collision fatalities also influence numbers of species colliding, and that the proportion, and potentially area, of glass lighted at night are associated with collisions. Thus, reducing bird collisions at large buildings, including stadiums, should be achievable by reducing glass area (or treating existing glass), reducing light emission at night, and prioritizing mitigation efforts for glass surfaces near vegetated areas and/or avoiding use of vegetation near glass.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224164&type=printable,journals.plos.org,anglais,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.37255137017233,,896

Knowledge of habitat use and selection by Eurasian Bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) is limited with regard to the non-breeding season. To date, research on the habitat of the Iberian subspecies iberiae consists of very general descriptions. In relation to space use, only broad features are available for the entire distribution range of Eurasian Bullfinches, including Iberia. In this study, seasonal preferences regarding habitat and space in a population of Eurasian Bullfinches are examined for the first time in the Iberian Peninsula, through direct observation during a six-year period. The essential habitat components, substrate selection and perch height were assessed. Hedgerows were the key essential habitat component for bullfinches during all seasons. Nevertheless, small poplar plantations became increasingly important from winter to summer-autumn. Bullfinches perched mostly in shrubs/trees throughout the year, but there were significant seasonal changes in substrate use, ground and herbs being of considerable importance during spring-summer. Throughout the year, over half of the records corresponded to feeding, reaching almost 90% in winter. Generally, bullfinches perched noticeably lower while feeding. Male bullfinches perched markedly higher than females, notably singing males in spring-summer. Juveniles perched at a height not much lower than that of males. In all seasons, males tended to feed at greater heights than females. Bullfinches of different ages and sexes were seen bathing in all seasons except winter. Hedgerow habitat in general appeared to be valuable for bullfinches throughout the year. In summer and autumn, they selected sites with an abundance of food and shade, as well as shelter, a much-needed requirement for fledglings and moulting individuals.

Comparisons of FDis between current and projected future assemblages showed consistent results across four dispersal scenarios, five climate models and two representative concentration pathways. Projections indicated a decrease of FDis in the lowlands, an increase of FDis at lower mid-elevations and little changes at high elevations.

Current fire frequencies and/or intensities in eastern North America are less than they were historically, thus changing gap dynamics and allowing mesic, fire-intolerant, shade-tolerant species to fill canopy gaps on many sites. Hence, many oak forests are changing in tree species composition. By contrast, it has been hypothesized that oak ecosystems are stable on xeric, nutrient-poor sites despite fire regime changes. We characterized the canopy gap regime and investigated changes in tree species composition in woodlands at the xeric edge of North American eastern deciduous forest. We used the line-intersect method to quantify canopy gap frequency, size, cause, and identities of gap replacement species in four young and four old post oak (Quercus stellata) woodlands in the Cross Timbers ecosystem of Kansas, USA. Woodland age did not affect gap characteristics. Canopy gap regime in these xeric woodlands was characterized by infrequent, small gaps that primarily form from snags or snapped boles. Through gap formation and filling, gradual change in the canopy composition of Kansas Cross Timbers woodlands is likely. Post oak dominates the canopy and forms the largest proportion of gaps, but it is the canopy replacement species in far-fewer gaps.

We conducted a predator playback experiment exposing white-tailed deer to the vocalizations of humans, extant or locally extirpated non-human predators (coyotes, cougars, dogs, wolves), or non-predator controls (birds), at supplemental food patches to measure the relative impacts on deer feeding behavior. Deer were more than twice as likely to flee upon hearing humans than other predators, and hearing humans was matched only by hearing wolves in reducing overall feeding time gaged by visits to the food patch in the following hour.

Here, we investigate two highly transformed urban wetlands in Cape Town, South Africa, and determine the relative importance and influence of local environmental variables as drivers of macroinvertebrate richness and community structuring. We also determine the influence of local environmental variables for patterns of species turnover and nestedness within and among these wetlands, and provide management recommendations based on our findings. We found that few macroinvertebrate species were associated with these wetlands, yet community variation was driven by a combination of local environmental variables. Our results also indicate that the turnover component of beta diversity, rather than nestedness, was responsible for most of the variation in the overall macroinvertebrate community. We identified two major problems regarding the current ecological state of the investigated wetlands. Firstly, high nutrient loads originating from the surrounding land uses which reduced wetland biodiversity, and secondly, the transformation of these wetlands from seasonal to perennial water bodies.

This study aimed to examine the effects of fire management on nest-site selection by the Red-legged Seriema, Cariama cristata, and to describe nest-building characteristics at Parque Nacional das Emas (PNE). Nests were searched and monitored throughout 34 study sites between October and November 2006.

This is probably due to mobility through often burnt vegetation and ease in obtaining food from adjacent unsealed roads, exotic plantations and cleared areas.

To highlight the potential contribution of such data, we used citizen science data to evaluate the migration timing and habitat occupancy of four migratory bird species whose movements are still understudied. In addition, based on our assessment, we suggest new avenues for citizen science-based research on migratory bird ecology in Brazil. Finally, given that the urban ecology of numerous Brazilian birds is still poorly understood, we highlight how this can be remediated through the efforts of birdwatchers, given that 73% of the data is concentrated within or nearby large urban centers in southern and southeastern Brazil. We show that data generated by citizen scientists can be useful for a suite of studies, such as on habitat use and migration patterns of Brazilian birds. Therefore, citizen science is an important way to improve our knowledge about Brazilian birds and promote their conservation in an era of rapid change. Nevertheless, its impact in the long term will depend on improving the quality of the data and involvement of more birdwatchers.

These factors vary with scale from interspecific interactions to global climatic cycles. Wetlands are important biodiversity hotspots and contributors of ecosystem services, but the association between proportional wetland cover and species richness has shown mixed results. It is not well known as to what extent there is a relationship between proportional wetland cover and species richness, especially at the sub-continental scale. We used the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) to model wetland cover for the conterminous United States and the National Land Cover Database to estimate wetland change between 2001 and 2011. We used a Bayesian spatial Poisson model to estimate a spatially varying coefficient surface describing the effect of proportional wetland cover on the distribution of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles and the cumulative distribution of terrestrial endemic species. Species richness and wetland cover were significantly correlated, and this relationship varied both spatially and by taxonomic group. Rather than a continental-scale association, however, we found that this relationship changed more closely among ecoregions. The species richness of each of the five groups was positively associated with wetland cover in some or all of the Great Plains; additionally, a positive association was found for mammals in the Southeastern Plains and Piedmont of the eastern U.S. Model results indicated negative association especially in the Cold Deserts and Northern Lakes & Forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin, though these varied greatly between groups.

Therefore, the effort invested by parents towards provisioning nestlings is crucial and represents a critical link between habitat resources and reproductive success. Recent studies suggest that the provisioning rate has little or no effect on the nestling growth rate. However, these studies do not consider prey quality, which may force breeding pairs to adjust provisioning rates to account for variation in prey nutritional value. In this 8-year study using black-capped (Poecile atricapillus) and boreal (Poecile hudsonicus) chickadees, we hypothesized that provisioning rates would negatively correlate with prey quality (i.e., energy content) across years if parents adjust their effort to maintain nestling growth rates. The mean daily growth rate was consistent across years in both species. However, prey energy content differed among years, and our results showed that parents brought more food to the nest and fed at a higher rate in years of low prey quality. This compensatory effect likely explains the lack of relationship between provisioning rate and growth rate reported in this and other studies. Therefore, our data support the hypothesis that parents increase provisioning efforts to compensate for poor prey quality and maintain offspring growth rates.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90658-w.pdf,nature.com,chickadee,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.4292372397909,"['poecile hudsonicus', 'poecile atricapillus']",328

Land management may combine with air temperature to influence the persistence of animal populations, so both must
be evaluated in concert to understand how populations respond to increased forest management intensity and projected climate change.
We used a large-scale study that experimentally manipulated herbicide application intensity within regenerating forests to test how
herbicide-mediated changes in temperature influenced three components of reproductive output in the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon):
nest survival, the number of offspring produced, and nestling body condition. We found no evidence for a consistent herbicide treatment
effect on any reproductive measure, although our power to detect effects was modest. Relative to unsprayed controls, nest survival was
lowest in the light herbicide treatment, and this measure increased on sites that were subjected to greater herbicide application (i.e., at
moderate and intensive herbicide treatments), against our predictions. We also detected no evidence of a temperature effect singly or
in combination with herbicide application on wren reproductive output. Although herbicide intensity was more influential on
reproductive output than was temperature, we found that neither exerted strong effects in regenerating conifer forests. Given the dearth
of studies that combine evaluations of temperature and land management impacts on songbird reproductive output, we suggest
researchers continue to expand our understanding of the relative influence of both drivers simultaneously to better formulate
conservation strategies in light of expected changes in climate and a heightened global demand for wood products.

Here, this question is addressed for the Laughing Dove (Spilopelia senegalensis), an expanding Afro-tropical bird in the Tunisian oasis habitat. This study took place in Kettana oasis, in south-eastern Tunisia. Natural Laughing Dove nests were searched for and monitored by means of regular visits, from the discovery date until the end of the breeding attempt (i.e. fledging or failure). Data were then used to investigate the relevance of laying date, nest age (days after clutch initiation), nest height and vegetation structure in the close nest tree environment as predictors of daily nest survival rate, using logistic-exposure models that accounted for heterogeneity in monitoring period among the studied nests. Models including different combinations of covariates were ranked according to their AICc scores, and the model-averaging technique was used for the assessment of the effects of covariates on daily nest survival rate. Vegetation structure in the close nest tree environment and nest age provided important predictors of daily nest survival rate, whereas neither nest height nor laying date showed significant effects. Daily nest survival rate was negatively associated with the presence of date palm trees in the close nest tree environment, but it was positively related to nest age. Daily nest survival rate was higher during the post-hatching stage than during the pre-hatching stage. Nests placed on fruit trees close to clumps of palm trees suffered higher predation risks compared to those placed on fruit trees situated far from palm trees. This is probably because palm tree clumps provided refuges for nest predators, notably the Black Rat (Rattus rattus) which has been reported to be the main nest predator in the oasis habitat. The predatory activity of this rodent seemed more directed against eggs than nestlings, which may explain the observed increase in daily survival rate with nest age.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0183-4,avianres.biomedcentral.com,bush-shrike,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.43746102637933,"['laughing dove', 'spilopelia senegalensis']",891

Our descriptions are based on comparisons of plumage, mitochondrial ND2 DNA sequences, and vocalizations of the new species and their congeners. The new Meratus jungle-flycatcher is most closely related to Cyornis montanus but morphologically distinguished by lighter blue on the upperparts and more whitish and less reddish on the underparts. The new Meratus white-eye is most closely related to Zosterops chloris but distinguished by olive upperparts and darker underparts. Vocalizations and genetic divergence values also corroborate species status for both new taxa. Both new species are probably confined to the Meratus Mountains, which are currently surrounded by degraded lower elevation secondary woodland or converted agricultural landscape. They appear to have diverged from their sister species through geographic isolation in this remote mountain range compounded by altered population dynamics in a depauperate montane bird community. Although both species are relatively common in the restricted area of the Meratus Mountains, continued habitat alteration and the imminent threat of poaching may be in the process of endangering them.

This also applies to Northern Angola but data on bushmeat and hunting techniques for this region are rare. Therefore, we study the most common hunting techniques, frequently captured species, and their economic value, and discuss the local resource use in relation to Angolan law and urgent global crises like the loss of biodiversity, the food supply in South African countries, and the risk of zoonoses. We recorded bushmeat hunting in 27 localities in the province of Uíge, accompanied hunters along their snare lines and interviewed additional 20 locals. Seven main types of snares and traps and their characteristics were defined. Hunters own on average 92 ± 128.7 snares and traps and capture about 25.3 ± 23.6 animals monthly. In total, respondents recognized 28 species of mammals of which one is considered as extinct and two as very rare. The majority of recorded species are hunted regularly. Rodents are most commonly caught followed by primates and duikers. Harvesting rates decrease with species’ body size, leading to high economic value of and achievable prices for rare, large animals. Overall, our results document the hunting pressure on mammals and the persisting popularity of bushmeat in Northern Angola which poses an imminent threat to remaining mammal populations. Moreover, it endangers ecosystem integrity, rural livelihoods, and human health through the risk of new zoonoses. Our findings underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions.

In these same regions, water demands for agriculture, urbanization, and recreation have altered the structure and composition of riparian forests and degraded bird habitat. Along rivers, plants with similar responses to flood disturbance and water availability can be grouped into functional guilds using traits. The use of plant guilds can mechanistically link bird distributions to traits such as canopy height, specific leaf area, and growth form. We demonstrate that bird species richness, abundance, and diversity are related to the heterogeneity of vegetation structure and plant guilds along a perennial river in the southwestern U.S. High-quality habitat can be explained by canopy cover, foliage height diversity, and foliage cover in the understory. The tall tree guild (dominated by Salix gooddingii) was the strongest predictor of bird habitat followed by drought tolerant shrubs (dominated by Prosopis velutina) demonstrating that riparian shrublands should be considered for conservation alongside gallery forests. Projected changes in flow regimes may result in homogenization of riparian vegetation and reduce habitat quality for migratory and breeding land birds.

To identify the crucial environmental factors associated with roost site selection, most studies have focused on the comparison of physical characteristics between roosts and non-roosts. However, the differences among roosts have usually been neglected and the causes of roost switching have seldom been investigated. To explore the variations among roost sites and assess the most influential environmental factors related to seasonal roost switching, we conducted a 105-day observation on an introduced population of critically endangered Yellow-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) in an urban environment in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016. We identified seven roost sites that were occupied in different seasons and then measured their microhabitat characteristics in terms of land use types, human disturbance and microclimate temperature. To quantify these differences, we used Pearson’s chi-squared test, partial least squares determinant analysis (PLS-DA) and one-way repeated measures ANOVA, respectively. Our results distinguished roost sites occupied in three seasons, i.e. spring, summer and winter roosts, using several microhabitat characteristics. The land use types were significantly associated with roosts, where spring roosts were usually located in tree-dominated areas, which are the major feeding grounds. The discriminant analysis on human disturbance variables indicated that summer roosts were positively associated with night illumination. The microhabitat temperatures of winter roosts were significantly higher than those of most other roosts on cold nights. The results highlighted significant variations among roosts, and seasonal roost switching was likely driven by specific microhabitat characteristics of each roost site, such as microclimate. It also helps us understand the behavioural adaptation of birds to urban environments.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00270-9,avianres.biomedcentral.com,wagtail,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.45346905225452,['cacatua sulphurea'],296

Dupont’s Lark is a threatened steppe-specialist passerine whose European geographic range is restricted to Spain, with less than 2000 pairs and an annual population decline of − 3.9%. Its strongly fragmented habitat leads to a metapopulation structure in the Iberian Peninsula that includes 24 populations and 100 subpopulations. We present an updated Population Viability Analysis based on the latest scientific knowledge regarding distribution, population trends, breeding biology and connectivity. Our results predict metapopulation extinction in 2–3 decades, through a centripetal contraction process from the periphery to the core. The probability of extinction in 20&nbsp;years was 84.2%, which supports its relisting to Endangered in Spain following IUCN criteria. We carried out a sensitivity analysis showing that some parameters, especially productivity and survival of adults and juveniles, help to increase metapopulation viability. Simulation of management scenarios showed that habitat restoration in a subset of key subpopulations had a positive effect on the overall metapopulation persistence. Translocations of a limited number of individuals from source to recipient locations may help to rescue the most endangered subpopulations without reducing the global time to extinction of the metapopulation. In addition, we identified the most critical areas for action, where local populations of the species are prone to extinction. This work suggests that the viability of the Dupont’s Lark metapopulation could be improved and its risk of extinction reduced if urgent and localized conservation measures are applied. In the short-term, habitat loss and fragmentation due to ploughing, reforestation and infrastructures implementation in Dupont’s Lark habitat must be avoided. Habitat restoration and translocations could help to avoid imminent extinction of critical subpopulations.

This enrichment can potentially transform and structure primary productivity, vegetation communities, and species richness. In a previous paleolimnological study, we examined approximately 1700 years of population change in the world’s largest colony of Leach’s Storm-petrel (Hydrobates leucorhous) on Baccalieu Island (Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada) and, using a variety of proxies, we identified two peaks in colony around 500 and 1980 CE. Here, we analyzed the same sediment cores for fossil pollen assemblages to explore the effects of changing seabird populations on terrestrial vegetation. Aerial imagery revealed the island’s vegetation cover that increased from about 23% to about 58% between 1940 and 2017, in part coinciding with the rapid colony growth until around 1980. Palynological analyses indicated shifts from tree and shrub habitat to storm-petrels’ preferred habitat of fern, grass, and moss during peak seabird abundances around 500 and 1980 CE. Also, during peaks in colony size, nitrogen-fixing alder (Alnus spp.) decreased in relative abundance likely due to poorer competitive potential because of guano-derived nitrogen fertilization. Furthermore, we observed increases in fungal hyphae concurrent with the inferred size of the storm-petrel colony, providing the potential for a novel proxy to track burrowing seabirds in sediment records. Collectively, our data show that storm-petrels acted as ecosystem engineers by markedly modifying the island’s vegetation cover and composition. If global seabird colonies continue to decline at current rates, there may be considerable bottom-up ramifications to terrestrial island ecosystems.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10021-020-00494-8.pdf,link.springer.com,duda,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.47895527738546,['hydrobates leucorhous'],791

To facilitate monitoring in the humid forests of northeast Central America, we conducted point count surveys for birds across gradients of disturbance in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize, and analyzed the association of bird species with remotely sensed metrics of forest condition and anthropogenic disturbance using indicator species analysis. Twenty species exhibited significant associations with one or more of these metrics. We propose six species as indicators for anthropogenic disturbance based on our criteria of being associated with anthropogenically disturbed sites, or anthropogenically disturbed and riparian sites with no explicit mention in the literature of an obligate association with riparian habitats, or association of remotely sensed metrics that appeared to reflect disturbance: yellow-olive flycatcher, red-legged honeycreeper, dusky antbird, blue ground dove, buff-throated saltator, and brown jay. We propose the keel-billed motmot as an indicator of undisturbed forest based on its association with forested sites in our analyses. Green shrike vireo, collard trogon, rufous-tailed jacamar, and rufous piha were associated with a specific elevational range but not associated with disturbance, so upward shifts in elevation that might indicate response to climate change would not be confounded with habitat disturbance or degradation.

This global gradient suggests that lowland species have had more time to diversify, or that net diversification rates have been higher in the lowlands. However, highlands seem to be cradles of diversity as they contain many young endemics, suggesting that their rates of speciation are exceptionally fast. Here we use a phylogenetic diversification model that accounts for the dispersal of species between different elevations to examine the evolutionary dynamics of the elevational diversity gradient in passerine birds, a group that has radiated globally to occupy almost all elevations and latitudes. We find strong support for a model in which passerines diversify at the same rate in the highlands and the lowlands but in which the per-capita rate of dispersal from high to low elevations is more than twice as fast as that in the reverse direction. This suggests that while there is no consistent trend in diversification across elevations, part of the diversity generated by highland regions migrates into the lowlands, thus setting up the observed gradient in passerine diversity. We find that this process drives tropical regions but for temperate areas, the analysis could be hampered by their lower richness. Despite their lower diversity, highland regions are disproportionally important for maintaining diversity in the adjacent lowlands. Diversification does not vary consistently across elevations, but highland species are more likely to migrate than lowland species, setting up species pumps that are particularly strong in the tropics.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01515-y.pdf,nature.com,leptopogon,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-6.482540109592236,,272

Four species of Pitta breed in the Philippines, two of which are endemic to the Archipelago. The attractive Azure-breasted Pitta, Pitta steerii, is found on the southern islands of Mindanao, Bohol, Samar and Leyte whereas the Whiskered Pitta P. kochi (which is also known as Koch's Pitta) is endemic to the northern island of Luzon. The Whiskered Pitta primarily inhabits montane evergreen forest and seems to favour montane oak forest especially where there is dense undergrowth and steep ravines. Until the last decade there had been very few observations of Whiskered Pitta. However, extensive surveys in Isabella and Cagayan provinces in the northern Sierra Madre mountains in the early 1990s by a team of Danish ornithologists discovered large populations of Whiskered Pittas and contributed much of what is known today about the ecology of this species. They found the pitta to be commonest in forest between 900 and 1400 metres where it preferred to forage for its invertebrate prey in damp soil and, in particular, in areas that had been recently disturbed by foraging wild pigs. Even for a pitta, a group renowned for their retiring nature, this species is generally extremely shy and secretive. They are largely terrestrial, seldom venturing more than a metre or two from the forest floor to call.

Indeed, at Mount Polis, a mountain in the Cordillera Central range which has been visited by many birders over the last decade the pitta has largely gone unnoticed until this year when up to five were heard in a small area in one morning.

Their availability may produce demographic and behavioural effects on bird populations, as happens with forest avifauna feeding on periodical cicadas in North America. In Europe, the Near East and North Africa, knowledge of cicada predation by birds is sparse. To help fill this gap, I consulted Cramp’s Birds of the Western Palearctic, conducted a search of online databases and used search engines to generate a database of Western Palearctic birds known to eat cicadas. A total of 105 species (16% of those occurring in the region) belonging to 13 orders, and comprising 20 of the 33 passerine families, were found to consume cicadas. I estimated that 69 of these bird species are known to consume cicadas within the limits of the Western Palearctic. Many terrestrial birds predate on cicadas, preferably on adults. Avian predators include cuckoos, owls, bee-eaters, woodpeckers, falcons, reed-warblers, larks, crows and jays, buntings, shrikes, pipits and wagtails, flycatchers and chats, tits, sparrows, leaf-warblers, starlings, warblers and thrushes, but also terns and gulls. Nymphs are consumed by some passerines, owls and herons. Cicadas can make up as much as 70% of food items delivered to nestlings. Analysis of stomach contents and neck collar samples are the most common methods used in diet studies. Available knowledge is biased towards species that have been more intensively studied, and often lack proper quantification of prey items. More studies about the relative importance of cicadas as prey for birds in the Western Palearctic are needed.

Vegetated habitats may pose a greater risk for some if vegetation characteristics function as a visual obstruction but benefit others if they serve as protective shelter. Variation in group size, presence of similar species, along with variation in environmental conditions and anthropogenic disturbance can also influence vigilance investment. In this study, we quantified the vigilance behaviour of two large-bodied, sympatric migratory curlew species—Far Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) and Eurasian Curlew (N. arquata)—in vegetated Suaeda salsa saltmarsh and non-vegetated mudflat habitat in Liaohekou National Nature Reserve, China. We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of habitat type, season, tide time, flock size (conspecific and heterospecific), and human disturbance on curlew vigilance investment. Both species spent a higher percentage of time under visual obstruction in S. salsa habitat compared to mudflat habitat but in response, only Far Eastern Curlew increased their percentage of vigilance time, indicating that visual obstruction in this habitat is only a concern for this species. There was no evidence that S. salsa vegetation served as a form of cryptic background colouration since neither species decreased their vigilance effect in S. salsa habitat in spring compared to the autumn migration season. The effect of curlew social environment (i.e. flock size) was habitat dependent since percentage of vigilance time by curlews in saltmarsh increased with both the number of individual curlews and number of other birds present, but not in mudflat habitat. We conclude that both migratory curlew species exhibit a flexible vigilance adjustment strategy to cope with the different environmental and social conditions of adjacent and sharply contrasting coastal habitats, and that the trade-off between the risks of foraging and the abundance of prey may be a relatively common phenomenon in these and other shorebird populations.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00274-5,avianres.biomedcentral.com,godwit,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.49894131117874,"['numenius madagascariensis', 'eurasian curlew', 'far eastern curlew', 'curlew']",276

Most previous studies assume that count indices are proportionally related to abundance; however, this assumption may not hold when detection varies spatially and temporally. We examined seasonal variations in abundance of three bird species (Cabot’s Tragopan Tragopan caboti, Silver Pheasant Lophura nycthemera, and White-necklaced Partridge Arborophila gingica) along an elevational gradient, using N-mixture models that take into account imperfect detection in our bird data. Camera-trapping was used to monitor temporal activity patterns of these species at Guangdong Nanling National Nature Reserve from December 2013 to November 2017 (4 seasons per year). For abundance analysis (N-mixture modeling), we divided a year into 4 seasons, i.e. 3 months per season, and performed the analysis by season. Elevation was incorporated into the N-mixture model as a covariate that may affect abundance. We compared the N-mixture model with a null model (no covariate model) and selected the better model based on AIC values to make an inference. From 24 sampling sites, we obtained 6786 photographs of 8482 individuals of 44 bird species and 26 mammal species. Silver Pheasant was photographed much more frequently and showed higher temporal activity frequency than White-necklaced Partridge or Cabot’s Tragopan. Silver Pheasant was camera-captured most frequently in summer, and other two species in winters. All three species had two daytime activity peaks: between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., and between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., respectively. Our estimated abundance and detection probability from the N-mixture model were variable by season. In particular, all three species showed greater abundance in summer than in winter, and estimated abundance patterns of all three species were more similar with observed camera-trapping counts in summers. Moreover, in winter, elevation had a positive impact on abundance of Silver Pheasant and Cabot’s Tragopan, but not on White-necklaced Partridge. Our results demonstrate that the N-mixture model performed well in the estimation of temporal population abundance at local fixed permanent plots in mountain habitat in southern China, based on the modeling of repeated camera-trapping counts. The seasonal differences in abundance of the three endemic bird species and the strong effect of elevation on abundance of two species in winter were only indicative of variations in spatio-temporal distribution within species and between species.

It is a much faster and accurate approach considering the large volume of data, than manual processing, which is extremely expensive, time-consuming, tedious, and monotonous. We established that machine learning and advancements in deep learning hold significant promise to high-accuracy identification of both species and individual animal. Methods used for individual identification are mainly implemented in endangered species by the conservation management. The traditional methods such as the use of footprints, drawings of animal biometrics are integrated into the recent growth of technology to eliminate the human skill needed to achieve species and individual identification through the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for automatic identification purposes.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10344-021-01549-4.pdf,link.springer.com,fin,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.51263894363378,,128

With the increasing conservation objectives, raised expectations into Protected Areas (PA), and within a more challenging environmental context, it is important to identify biodiversity hubs and key areas for Ecosystem Services (ES) to maximize the efficiency of conservation efforts by assisting priority areas under threats. To date, no comprehensive analysis, to the best of our knowledge has been done to assess both biodiversity and ES in Rwanda. This is a notable gap, considering that global-scale research suggests that the spatial overlap between biodiversity targets and ES is low. This study reports a nationwide assessment, mapping the richness of threatened species and three key ES Carbon Storage, Water Quantity, and Water Quality. Our analysis has shown that PAs are neither perfectly delineated to protect biodiversity nor key ES. The state of PAs offers a taxonomic protection bias in favor of mammals and birds but leaves many endangered species in other taxonomic groups in collapsing and unprotected small ecosystems scattered around the country. Rwanda’s PAs cover important carbon stock but can do better at securing higher water balance regions and clean water sources. We propose an improvement of the NP system in Rwanda to help guide the economic development along a path of green growth and ensures the well-being of both people and nature.

Leveraging advances in DNA metabarcoding and using radio-telemetry, we present novel information on the diet and movement of V. spectrum based on locations of a radio-collared individual and fecal samples collected from its communal roost (three individuals) in the Lowland Dry Forest of southern Nicaragua. Using a non-invasive approach, we explored the diet of the species with genetic markers designed to capture a range of arthropods and vertebrate targets from fecal samples. We identified 27 species of vertebrate prey which included birds, rodents, and other bat species. Our evidence suggested that V. spectrum can forage on a variety of species, from those associated with mature forests to forest edge-dwellers. Characteristics of the roost and our telemetry data underscore the importance of large trees for roosting in mature forest patches for the species.

Reducing these fatalities is essential to ensure that the global increase in wind-energy facilities can occur with minimal impact on bat populations. Although individual bats have been observed approaching wind turbines, and fatalities frequently reported, it is unclear whether bats are actively attracted to, indifferent to, or repelled by, the turbines at large wind-energy installations. In this study, we assessed bat activity at paired turbine and control locations at 23 British wind farms. The research focussed on Pipistrellus species, which were by far the most abundant bats recorded at these sites. P. pipistrellus activity was 37% higher at turbines than at control locations, whereas P. pygmaeus activity was consistent with no attraction or repulsion by turbines. Given that more than 50% of bat fatalities in Europe are P. pipistrellus, these findings help explain why Environmental Impact Assessments conducted before the installation of turbines are poor predictors of actual fatality rates. They also suggest that operational mitigation (minimising blade rotation in periods of high collision risk) is likely to be the most effective way to reduce collisions because the presence of turbines alters bat activity.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-82014-9.pdf,nature.com,barré,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.52454885627805,,433

This poorly known species is considered ‘Near Threatened’, but recent studies have suggested that it should be listed under a higher category of threat. To contribute to the knowledge of this species and its conservation assessment and related planning, we compiled all literature records of the species distribution (n = 16 locations), collected new data on its occurrence (n = 72 locations), and calculated its geographic range using four different approaches. First, we defined the sky islands where the species occurs (nine units) using the lowest elevation value recorded (1,100 m asl) as a cut-off. Second, we performed species distribution modelling (SDM) across the sky islands and identified an area of 2,225.21 km2. Third, we measured the species’ extent of occurrence (EOO = 24,555.85 km2) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (EOOup = 30,697.58 km2). Fourth, we measured the area of occupancy (AOO = 228 km2) and used SDM to estimate its upper limit (AOOup = 1,827.39 km2). We analysed the Cipo Canastero sky islands in terms of landscape metrics including size, isolation, protected area coverage, shape index, core area index, and proportion covered by SDM. We observed a very fragmented distribution, especially in the North sector of the species distribution, composed of small and isolated populations (separated by up to 112 km); the South sector is the core of its distribution and is composed of larger, more connected patches with differences in shape complexity that are not strongly influenced by an edge effect.

We present data from a rapid survey on 1-year post-opening colonisation and use of waterbirds in a recently constructed 11 ha restricted-access sewage treatment plant, situated in Ghana’s capital, Accra. During November-December 2013 and January 2014, nine daily counts in each month produced an accumulated count of >4200 observations belonging to 26 species of waterbirds, including several important Afro-Palaearctic and intra-African migrants, hereunder ardeids, piscivorous divers, waterfowl and waders. The distributional patterns of waterbirds clearly reflected local foraging opportunities and water quality parameters in the system of 12 inter-connected waste stabilisation ponds. A nearby semi-natural wetland with cleaner waterbodies, but higher levels of human interference, supported fewer waterbirds, predominantly commensal gregarious species. Our data suggests that strict protection from disturbances outweighs possible negative implications attributed to mere pollution of waterbodies supporting various waterbird guilds, thus highlighting the potential importance of informally protected sewage treatment plants distributed in functional networks, as a complement to designated wetlands.

Here, test the suitability of the Mackinnon Lists Technique for use in the marine environment by testing its effectiveness for rapid assessment of fish communities. The MacKinnon Lists Technique is a time-efficient and cost-effective sampling method developed for studying avian tropical biodiversity, in which several list samples of species can be collected from a single survey. Using the well-established MaxN approach on data from deployments of a Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems for comparison, we tested the suitability of the MacKinnon Lists Technique for use in marine environments by analysing tropical reef fish communities. Using both methods for each data set, differences in community composition between depths and levels of protection were assessed. Both methods were comparable for diversity and evenness indices with similar ranks for species. Multivariate analysis showed that the MacKinnon Lists Technique and MaxN detected similar differences in community composition at different depths and protection status. However, the MacKinnon Lists Technique detected significant differences between factors when fewer videos (representing reduced survey effort) were used. We conclude that the MacKinnon Lists Technique is at least as effective as the widely used MaxN method for detecting differences between communities in the marine environment and suggest can do so with lower survey effort.

Qinghai Lake marked birds overwintered in the QTP (n = 2), geese tagged in Mongolia wintered either in the QTP (n = 3) or in India/Bangladesh (n = 9), representing three of the migration routes within the ETF. In total, tagged birds staged at 79 different stopover sites within QTP in autumn and 23 in spring, of which 65% (autumn) and 59% (spring) of all fixes fell within the boundaries of either National Nature Reserves (NNRs) or Important Birds Areas (IBAs) in the QTP. Bar-headed Geese predominantly occurred on four land-cover types: grassland (mostly by day), water bodies (at night), wetlands and bare substrates (salt flats, dry lake/river substrates and plough) with little change in proportion. Generalized linear mixed models comparing presence with pseudo-absence data suggested geese strongly selected for wetlands as staging habitat, avoiding bare substrates in spring. Based on our limited observations of these tagged geese, this study is the first to show that the current designated National Nature Reserves in place in the staging areas within the QTP appear adequate to protect this increasing population. In addition, Hala Lake in Qinghai Province and adjacent areas used as initial QTP staging during autumn migration (currently outside of designated as NNRs/IBAs) are recommended for protection, based on their use by tagged birds from this study. Habitat modelling confirmed the importance of natural wetlands as feeding areas and safe areas of open water as roosting places.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00230-9,avianres.biomedcentral.com,bishop,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.55608975791032,['anser indicus'],498

A possible explanation for this similarity is the spread of montane habitat into the intervening lowlands during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene, allowing biotic exchange between mountain ranges. In this study, we sought to infer the existence and most likely positions of these potential habitat corridors. We focused on sixteen Afromontane endemic tree, shrub, and bird species in the Cameroon Volcanic Line, East African Rift and Great Escarpment. Species were chosen based on distribution above 1200–1500 m in at least two of the major Afromontane regions. Ecological niche models were developed for each species in the present and projected to the mid-Holocene and the last glacial maximum (LGM). Models were thresholded to create binary maps of presence/absence and then summed across taxa to estimate potential LGM and mid-Holocene distributions. We found widespread climatic suitability for our montane taxa throughout the lowlands of Central Africa during the LGM, connecting all regions of the Afromontane archipelago except the Ethiopian Highlands and the Dahomey Gap. During the mid-Holocene, we noted more limited climatic suitability for fewer species in lowland areas.

Modeling studies describe how species have reacted in the past to climatic change, and this information can help us to understand the degree of biotic susceptibility to current and future climatic change. This work aims to determine the effects of past, current and future climatic changes on the geographic distribution of the species complex Thamnophilus punctatus, a bird clade widely distributed across Neotropical dry forests. We also investigate if species that are phylogenetically similar have comparable climatic niches and, consequently, can be expected to respond similarly to climatic change. For this purpose, we calculated similarity, niche overlap, equivalence and genetic distance between all species, modeling their geographic distributions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as well as under current conditions and future (2050–2080) scenarios. Our results indicate that there are differences in responses to climatic changes from the LGM to the present among the five species of the T. punctatus complex and that the niches in the measured dimensions are not conserved among the studied species. We therefore suggest that the adequate environmental space of taxa of a widely distributed lineage can be shaped in distinct way, regardless of how closely related their species are or how much their niches overlap. Competitive exclusion in zones of contact is an important factor determining the geographical range of the species of the Thamnophilus punctatus complex, particularly for the very closely related species T. sticturus, T. pelzelni and T. ambiguus.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01721-3.pdf,link.springer.com,streaked-antwren,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-6.5611927642052,['thamnophilus punctatus'],935

Background: Reconciling agriculture and biodiversity conservation is a challenge given the growing demand for 
agricultural products. In recent decades, Argentina has witnessed agricultural expansion and intensification affect-
ing biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Within agroecosystems, the level of habitat quality is critical for 
birds, and may depend on vegetation structure, availability of invertebrate prey, and the use of pesticides. Although 
the relationship between vegetation structure and avian occurrence has been widely studied, to our knowledge, 
there are no studies that also incorporate prey availability throughout the cycle of soybean crops in Argentina. We 
estimated and predicted the effects of land cover and temporal variation on the occurrence of avian foraging guilds 
in Entre Ríos, Argentina, in order to guide management related to potential ecosystem services provided by birds. We 
also estimated temporal effects of vegetation structure and insecticides on the main arthropod orders consumed by 
birds to evaluate prey availability.
Methods: We conducted bird and arthropod surveys for 2 years along transects located in 20 randomly selected 
soybean fields (N = 60) and their adjacent borders (N = 78) throughout the crop growing season, in four seasons. 
We estimated avian occupancy, accounting for imperfect detection, and arthropod counts fitting generalized linear 
mixed models.
Results: The number of native trees in field borders positively influenced the occurrence of most bird species, mainly 
insectivores. Granivore foliage gleaners, also were positively affected by grass height. Salliers and aerial foragers were 
weakly affected by distance to forest and native trees. In general, the availability of invertebrates to birds was highest 
during the third season. Arthropod counts in borders were greater during the last three crop stages than during the 
pre-sowing period.
Conclusions: We found that with 10 to 15 native tree species in borders, coupled with a complex vegetation struc-
ture with shrubs and grasses, we could conserve a wide spectrum of insectivorous birds, and may contribute to the 
invertebrate pest control service. Vegetated field borders function as a refuge for arthropods, especially agriculturally",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00235-4.pdf,avianres.biomedcentral.com,grey-tyrant,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-6.568190629675009,,500

Satellite tracking has been an integral part of identifying the causes for declines in the migratory populations in Europe and Africa, and consequently where conservation efforts should be focussed to halt the decline of “the white scavenger vulture”. The situation, however, is much less clear in central Asia where its migratory populations, numbering an estimated 700–1,300 pairs, are also thought to be declining. There are few data available on population status or trends and nothing is known about their migration routes or wintering sites. While some threats, such as electrocution, are known on the breeding grounds, little is known about the relative importance of threats, their demographic impacts and how these vary during migration. The recent Convention on Migratory Species Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures identified these critical gaps in knowledge as a key priority needing to be addressed. The Central Asian Vultures Project (www.CentralAsianVultures.org) aims to tackle this by satellite tracking Egyptian Vultures originating from the Uzbekistan population where there is estimated to be only 135 breeding pairs and the species is listed in the National Red Data Book.  Uzbekistan is in the middle of the central Asian-Indian flyway with many migrants funnelled through it because of the Caspian Sea in the west and the Hindu Kush range in the east. This flyway ends with Iraq in the west and Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent in the east. The majority of Uzbekistan is covered in desert, with the Kyzylkum Desert at its centre. The semi-arid region is predominantly flat, but does provide some nesting habitat for the Egyptian Vulture in the form of low-lying hills and cliffs along wadi systems. In August 2021, the field team visited three different nests in the regions of Ayakaghytma and Bukantau in central Kyzylkum and satellite tagged four juvenile Egyptian Vultures (read about the birds here). Of the four birds, three transmitted GPS data allowing their movements to be tracked for the first time in Asia. All three birds started migration from Uzbekistan between 5–15th September 2021. Each bird took a different route with two (Arys & Anya) migrating via Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan and ultimately wintering in India (Rajasthan and Haryana). The third bird, Timur, took a very different route making a long journey with several stops through Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and finally arriving in Yemen in late November 2021 (Fig. 1).

Karsenia koreana is the only known Asian plethodontic salamander, occurring in a very restricted area only. Based on presence data, we created an ecological model using six bioclimatic factors with low multicollinearity to define the adequate habitat of the species, and we modelled the predicted suitability of the Korean landscape following four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) predicting climate change scenarios based on CO2 concentrations in 2050 and 2070. The maximum entropy model for the current distribution produced a landscape suitability considerably wider than the current known distribution. The projected ranges for each RCP indicated marked increases, decreases and shifts in areas with suitable landscapes due to climate change. The lowest RCP prediction resulted in an increase in suitable area, although potentially without connectivity with current populations, while the highest RCP predictions resulted in a decrease.

In large protected North American areas such as Yellowstone and Wood Buffalo National Parks, aquatic habitats are disappearing and wetland-dependent fauna are in decline1–3. Here we investigate population dynamics of an indicator species in Canada’s Peace-Athabasca Delta (“the delta”), a World Heritage Site. Based on population surveys, habitat mapping and genetic data from 288 muskrats, we use agent-based modeling and genetic analyses to explain population expansion and decline of the semi-aquatic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). Simulations quantify a large population (~500,000 individuals) following flood-induced habitat gains, with decreased size (~10,000 individuals) during drying. Genetic analyses show extremely low long-term effective population size (Ne: 60–127), supporting a legacy of population bottlenecks. Our simulations indicate that the muskrat population in the delta is a metapopulation with individuals migrating preferentially along riparian pathways. Related individuals found over 40 km apart imply dispersal distances far greater than their typical home range (130 m). Rapid metapopulation recovery is achieved via riparian corridor migration and passive flood-transport of individuals. Source-sink dynamics show wetland loss impacts on the muskrat metapopulation’s spatial extent.

Background: The European Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) is a small plunge-diving bird, today considered a species of 
conservation concern in Europe given its rapid population decline observed across the continent. We implemented 
a pilot study aimed at providing first data allowing to: (1) assess home range features of the European Kingfisher for 
populations with unevenly distributed feeding habitats; (2) define conservation implications for habitats exploited by 
such populations; and (3) evaluate possibilities for developing GPS tracking schemes dedicated to home range stud-
ies for this species that could be possibly applied to other small plunge-diving birds.
Methods: In 2018 and 2019, we equipped 16 breeding European Kingfishers sampled within the marshes of the 
Gironde Estuary (France), with miniaturized and waterproof GPS archival tags deployed with leg-loop harnesses (total 
equipment mass = 1.4 g; average bird mass = 40.18 ± 1.12 g).
Results: On average, we collected 35.31 ± 6.66 locations usable for analyses, without a significant effect on bird body 
condition (n = 13 tags retrieved). Data analyses highlighted rather limited home ranges exploited by birds (aver-
age = 2.50 ± 0.55 ha), composed on average by 2.78 ± 0.40 location nuclei. Our results also underscore: (1) a rather 
important home range fragmentation index (0.36 ± 0.08); and (2) the use by birds of different types of small wetlands 
(wet ditches, small ponds or small waterholes), often exploited in addition to habitats encompassing nest locations.
Conclusions: Our study reveals interesting GPS tracking possibilities for small plunge-diving birds such as the 
European Kingfisher. For this species, today classified as vulnerable in Europe, our results underline the importance of 
developing conservation and ecological restoration policies for wetland networks that would integrate small wet-

These materials potentially contain information about past breeding success in con- and heterospecifics and may improve the thermal insulation of eggs during incubation. However, few studies have addressed whether the presence of old nest materials serves as a cue for cavity-nesting raptors when choosing specific nest sites. We conducted a 9-year nest box experiment to test whether old nest materials from con- and heterospecifics serve as informative cues to the European Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) when making nest selection decisions, as this species uses nest boxes without adding nesting material. The presence of old nest materials and entrance size best discriminated nest boxes occupied by European Kestrels from unoccupied boxes. Nest boxes containing conspecific organic remains, artificial dry leaf and branch material, and material left behind by Great Tits (Parus major) were reused at higher rates, especially those containing conspecific nest material, than nest boxes containing true or simulated nest materials from predators. In 2010, no single nest box was occupied by the same banded individual that occupied the box in the previous year (10 females and 2 males were banded in 2009). European Kestrels preferred nest boxes containing old nest material over empty boxes, which is consistent with previous findings that they exploit con- and heterospecific cues when deciding where to settle and breed, as old nest or organic material provides substrate for incubating females. Kestrels may be able to assess the predation risks associated with a specific nest site based on experience or the presence of prey remains. The repeated use of nest boxes across breeding seasons by kestrels cannot be entirely ascribed to philopatry. This study provides evidence that old nest materials are potentially used as informative cues when making nest-site selection decisions in European Kestrels.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0182-5,avianres.biomedcentral.com,kestrel,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.58543620787107,"['falco tinnunculus', 'parus major', 'kestrel']",893

Despite the importance of these effects on hosts, and extensive research of Philornis downsi in the Galápagos, the ecology of most species of philornid nest flies is poorly understood. We examined biotic factors related to Philornis pici infestations of nestling Ridgway’s hawks in the Dominican Republic, where both fly and hawk are native. We found grass-cover was negatively associated with P. pici infestations, while coverage and height of other vegetation classes (tree, shrub, herbaceous, and bare ground) had no association, which is interesting considering recent landscape-level changes to Ridgway’s hawk habitat. Anthropogenic activities in Los Haitises National Park, the last strong-hold of Ridgway’s hawk, have shifted the landscape from primary forest to a fragmented secondary forest with smallholder or subsistence farms and grassy patches.

Moreover, the SARu can be explained by 20 different models. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate which models provide a better explanation of SARus and, focusing on the power model, to evaluate the global heterogeneity in its fit and slope. We tested the performance of multiple statistical models in accounting for the way in which species richness increases with area, and examined whether variability in model form was associated with various methodological and environmental factors. Focusing on the power model, we analyzed the global heterogeneity in the fit and slope of the models through a meta-analysis. Among 20 analyzed models, the linear model provided the best fit to the most datasets, was the top ranked model according to our efficiency criterion, and was the top overall ranked model. The Kobayashi and power models were the second and third overall ranked models, respectively. The number of green areas and the minimum number of species within a green area were the only significant variables explaining the variation in model form and performance, accounting for less than 10% of the variation. Based on the power model, there was a consistent overall fit (r2 = 0.50) and positive slope of 0.20 for the species richness increase with area worldwide. The good fit of the linear model to our SARu datasets contrasts with the non-linear SAR frequently found in true and non-urban habitat island systems; however, this finding may be a result of the small sample size of many SARu datasets. The overall power model slope of 0.20 suggests low levels of isolation among urban green patches, or alternatively that habitat specialist and area sensitive species have already been extirpated from urban green areas.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0168-3,avianres.biomedcentral.com,fox,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.5921748377068,,973

Some feathers from each tracked juvenile were collected for molecular identification of sex in the laboratory. The GPS locations, recorded at 2-h intervals from August 2018 to May 2020, were used for the analyses.

Our results revealed significant differences in clutch size, egg size and the fledging rate between the first and second brood of Saxaul Sparrows and suggested that this typical desert species allocates more breeding resources to the more favourable second brood period, leading to greater reproductive output. Female body size presented a positive relationship with egg size, and male body size presented positive relationships with clutch size and hatchability. The females that started their clutches later laid more eggs, and hatchability and the fledging rate also increased with a later laying date in the first brood period. With successive eggs laid within the 5-egg clutches (the most frequent clutch size), egg size increased for the first three eggs and then significantly decreased.

The study of the stressful effects of human disturbances on animal distribution, physiology and behaviour can provide fundamental insights for wildlife conservation. Here, we assess how two declining birds, the European Roller Coracias garrulus and the European Scops Owl Otus scops, cope with alteration by human activities in farming habitats of the south of Spain. We studied nest distribution, quantified nestling physiology (corticosterone levels in plasma and feathers and body weight close to fledgling) and parental behaviour (feeding rates) of both species along a human alteration gradient. Rollers and Scops Owls used the same type of habitat and their spatial distribution was not determined by individual quality. In Rollers, nestlings raised in scrubland areas had high stress-induced corticosterone levels, possibly due to high predation risk in this habitat. In addition, Rollers and Scops Owls showed opposite relationships with farming activity and human disturbance. Nestling Rollers showed the highest corticosterone levels in feathers, weight and parental feeding rates in areas with intense farming activity. These results suggest that despite the disturbance produced by farming activities, inducing a higher stress in these areas, cultivated areas may, simultaneously, provide parents with a higher abundance of prey which would trigger increased feeding rates and, hence, higher nestling weights. Furthermore, nestling Scops Owls showed the highest stress-induced corticosterone levels in areas close to roads, suggesting that they would be affected by human disturbance due to infrastructures that disturb also at night when Scops Owls are active. Therefore, susceptibility to human disturbance may vary between species, probably due to variation in the daily pattern of human activities and the species’ activity rhythm, buffering or exacerbating the effects, which should be considered in future studies on human alterations and birds.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DC8C9F9F338029D80F6A5A269F88BCB8/S0959270919000388a.pdf/div-class-title-physiological-stress-and-behavioural-responses-of-european-rollers-and-eurasian-scops-owls-to-human-disturbance-differ-in-farming-habitats-in-the-south-of-spain-div.pdf,cambridge.org,curvirostre,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.59998384845967,"['european scops owl', 'coracias garrulus', 'european roller', 'otus scops']",962

Recently two large wildfires (around the towns of Knysna in 2017 and George in 2018) jointly burnt over 80 000 ha in the southern Cape, South Africa. Here, patches of closed-canopy Afrotemperate forest occur within a matrix of fire-prone (native) fynbos shrublands or adjacent to commercial plantations of invasive alienPinustrees (a transformed state). We compared the distances that fire penetrated into forest margins adjacent to fynbos to those adjacent to plantations. Furthermore, we used a satellite-derived index of fire severity, the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR), to compare fire severity in forest margins adjacent to fynbos to those adjacent to plantations. Results were inconsistent between the two fires. In the Knysna fire, no significant difference was noted in fire penetration into forest, while forest margins adjacent to plantations burnt at significantly lower severity than those adjacent to fynbos. In the George fire, penetration into and fire severity in forest margins adjacent to plantations were significantly greater than in those adjacent to fynbos. Not only were fire severity and penetration in forest margins with plantations adjacent dissimilar between the George and Knysna fires, but variability in fire severity was greater in forest margins with plantation adjacent than in those with fynbos adjacent. Our study provides evidence that fire severity in forest margins is associated with the adjacent vegetation type and that plantations potentially expose forests to greater variability in fire severity and extent than the forest may experience under natural conditions. Other important factors that may affect the severity and extent of burn in forest margins are forest patch size and topographical position, the nature of the ecotone between forest and the adjacent vegetation, and the fuel load and structure of the adjacent vegetation which varies considerably in relation to stand age and management practices in plantations.",,nisc.co.za,knysna,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.615333542535071,,109

Existing research focuses mainly on immediate displacement as a disturbance effect, since this can be easily observed in the field. However, effects on movement over longer timescales are poorly examined and it is largely unknown if and to what extent they reflect immediate responses. Longer-term responses could for example be larger than immediate responses if birds, after disturbance, return to the original location and thereby travel twice the immediate disturbed distance. We combined GPS tracking data with observational data to quantify the effects of anthropogenic (air force and walkers) and non-anthropogenic disturbances on distances travelled by roosting Eurasian Oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) during the non-breeding season. We compared immediate displacement after a disturbance with distance travelled during the entire high tide period (longer-term response), while accounting for environmental factors. Additionally, we calculated energy expenditure due to disturbance based on observed disturbance frequencies. Disturbance resulted in an immediate displacement response of ~ 200 m (median). Air force disturbances tended to yield larger immediate responses than walker and, especially, than non-anthropogenic disturbances. Longer-term responses and immediate responses were approximately similar, suggesting that, over longer timescales, spatial disturbance effects in the study area remain confined to immediate effects. However, disturbances were infrequent (0.17 disturbances per bird per hour) and most disturbances were of natural origin (62%). Consequently, anthropogenic disturbance of roosting oystercatchers in the study area on average costs 0.08% of the daily energy expenditure. Our results suggest that immediate spatial responses to disturbance can be a useful proxy for spatial responses over longer timescales. Over the non-exhaustive range of conditions investigated, energetic consequences of spatial disturbance responses for an oystercatcher in the study area are marginal due to low disturbance levels.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0171-8,avianres.biomedcentral.com,minute,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.6160189241292,"['haematopus ostralegus', 'oystercatcher']",972

Based on the mapping results, the nesting densities and average sizes of the nesting home range of individual birds are estimated for each bird species and raster maps of spatial allocation (MSAs) at a scale of the raster grid of 50 × 50 m are obtained for each species. The degree of spatial conservatism (DSC) for each local population is inferred from the pairwise comparisons of the specific MSAs obtained on the same area (31.5 ha) in different years with the use of the Gamma rank correlation method. The dependence of the population habitat area on the DSC was demonstrated earlier (Cherenkov, 2017). The larger habitat area is found within the sample plot, an a less dependent individual spatial allocation within a population is observed in different years. Based on the estimated specific habitat areas, average sizes of the individual nesting home range, and estimated nesting density, the maximum possible nesting density and habitat saturation are calculated for each species. The population status is inferred from the degree of habitat saturation. Significant DSC estimates (p < 0.05) are obtained for nine species; their habitat areas and saturation are found. It is shown that habitat saturation in nonmigratory birds is twice as high an in migratory ones. On average, habitat saturation was 54–58% in nonmigratory birds and 26% in migratory ones (F = 9.1; p < 0.01). In the two species, the orange-flanked bush-robin (Tarsiger cyanurus Pallas, 1773) and taiga flycatcher (Ficedula (parva) albicilla Pallas, 1811), the habitat saturation is less than 20%, which indicates the presumably troubled status of their populations.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S199542551903003X.pdf,link.springer.com,baikal,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.61885767748541,"['robin', 'taiga flycatcher', 'tarsiger cyanurus']",1041

We hypothesized that large anisodactylous birds, because of their larger size, can disperse a higher number of species. A laboratory experiment with zooplankton dispersal simulation by birds’ feet was carried out, using dry sediments collected at different past phases of water accumulation in a temporary pond, which represent the flood (upper egg bank) and drought (lower egg bank), intending to evaluate differences in species richness between these phases. The lower egg bank showed higher species richness (42 species) while the samples from upper egg banks presented almost the same number of species (35 or 36 at each one). The number of eggs carried on each footprint model (treatment) was different, and it was higher for large anisodactyl feet with 46 species, supporting the hypothesis of the study.

In birds, adverse effects include changes in vocalization patterns. Helicopters and songbirds are ubiquitous in protected natural areas but the effect of helicopter noise on songbirds has never been assessed. Objectives Our objective was to determine if helicopter noise affects temporal characteristics of songbird vocalizations within protected natural areas. Methods We collected soundscape recordings in three protected areas with varying levels of helicopter tour activity, including one with the second highest air tour activity in the United States. We examined songbird response to helicopter noise at the species level by measuring changes in vocalization time, and at the community level by employing the Bioacoustic Index, an acoustic measure of biological sound. Results We found a strong association between increasing helicopter noise and songbird vocalizations, indicating that some bird species use temporal shifts in vocalizations to mitigate masking effects from helicopter noise. The strength and direction of the response was species-specific, suggesting differences in resilience to helicopter noise between species. Furthermore, our results suggest that bird response to helicopter noise is strongest in areas with very loud and frequent helicopter traffic. Conclusions Our study is the first to examine and demonstrate impacts of helicopter noise on songbird vocalizations. Our results may serve as the foundation of an air tour management plan that considers reducing the number of helicopter overflights over protected natural areas and enforcing higher flight altitudes to decrease noise power levels.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-020-01179-2.pdf,link.springer.com,omao,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-6.62031534785239,,463

We employed systematic camera trapping and spatially explicit capture-recapture modelling to estimate variation in population density of serval, striped hyaena and aardwolf across the mixed-use Ruaha-Rungwa landscape in southern Tanzania. We selected three sites representative of different habitat types, management strategies, and levels of anthropogenic pressure: Ruaha National Park’s core tourist area, dominated by Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets; the Park’s miombo woodland; and the neighbouring community-run MBOMIPA Wildlife Management Area, also covered in Acacia-Commiphora. The Park’s miombo woodlands supported a higher serval density (5.56 [Standard Error = ±2.45] individuals per 100 km2) than either the core tourist area (3.45 [±1.04] individuals per 100 km2) or the Wildlife Management Area (2.08 [±0.74] individuals per 100 km2). Taken together, precipitation, the abundance of apex predators, and the level of anthropogenic pressure likely drive such variation. Striped hyaena were detected only in the Wildlife Management Area and at low density (1.36 [±0.50] individuals per 100 km2), potentially due to the location of the surveyed sites at the edge of the species’ global range, high densities of sympatric competitors, and anthropogenic edge effects. Finally, aardwolf were captured in both the Park’s core tourist area and the Wildlife Management Area, with a higher density in the Wildlife Management Area (13.25 [±2.48] versus 9.19 [±1.66] individuals per 100 km2), possibly as a result of lower intraguild predation and late fire outbreaks in the area surveyed. By shedding light on three understudied African carnivore species, this study highlights the importance of miombo woodland conservation and community-managed conservation, as well as the value of by-catch camera trap data to improve ecological knowledge of lesser-studied carnivores.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242293&type=printable,journals.plos.org,miombo,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-6.62322549670032,,386

Our primary goal was to describe its diet at Kerguelen Islands, which is the southernmost breeding locality of the species. Soft-plumaged petrels fed on fish (71% by mass), and secondarily on crustaceans (22%), while cephalopods (7%) and other items (< 1%) were minor dietary components. Eight-hundred and sixty prey were identified from the pooled 33 food samples, with the 2 hyperiid amphipods Cyllopus magellanicus (48%) and Themisto gaudichaudii (35%) being the main food items by number. Owing to their larger size than crustaceans, mesopelagic fishes were the main prey by mass, with myctophids being the most important fish family in terms of both abundance (68% of the fish) and diversity (10 species). Prey distribution indicated that soft-plumaged petrels foraged primarily in oceanic subantarctic waters to feed their chicks. The oceanic life style of gadfly petrels was then highlighted by a review of their diet worldwide (20 species, 26 studies). Gadfly petrels prey mainly upon mesopelagic fishes (chiefly myctophids) and squids with their relative proportions depending on species and localities. Crustaceans are minor food items for tropical species, but they form a significant part of the food of the small- and medium-sized petrels that live in temperate and cold waters.

These results allowed us to increase the trapping success whilst reducing the effort. During the captures, systematic collection of catch and effort data allowed to estimate population size (65 ± 7.8 raccoons) and thus to have a continuous update on how far the campaign was from the complete eradication of the species, allowing to adjust the trapping effort accordingly. We captured 69 raccoons (7279 cage trap nights) thanks to both systematic trapping and opportunistic activation of traps following stakeholders’ reports. Stakeholders supported the campaign and some of them played an important role in reporting sightings, signs, and allowing access to their private land.

In Patagonia Argentina, most nature reserves focus their protection objectives on a particular ecosystem, geoform or scenic value, and usually are located in inaccessible areas. However, unique species or assemblages could inhabit less protected ecosystems, areas or habitats, which could be threatened depending of management. In this study, we assessed the conservation value of different ecosystem types and areas (fjords) in Isla de los Estados Provincial Reserve (RPIE, Argentina), using birds as study case. We chose three fjords (east, central and west) and five ecosystems types (forests at low and high elevation, open-lands at low and high elevation, and sea coasts). Bird’s assemblage richness, density, biomass, trophic level, migratory status, and use of strata per ecosystems and fjords were characterized in 75 points (3 fjords × 5 ecosystems × 5 replicates) and evaluated using ANOVA and multivariate methods. Also, Shannon (H’) and Pielou (J) indices were estimated for fjords and ecosystems. Passerine was the most abundant group, being mainly residents, omnivorous and carnivorous-scavenger, and they were observed mainly flying or in the canopy. Assemblage structure and function varied with ecosystem types, with higher richness and biomass in coasts and open-lands than in other ecosystems, but with greater density in forests. Multivariate analyses showed conspicuous groups for forests and coast sampling units, with significant differences among all ecosystem types except between low and high forests. Also, east fjord significantly differed in density and biomass from the others, but west fjord also differed in structure, function and bird assemblage. We conclude that greater conservation value must be assigned to ecosystem types or areas inhabited by threatened species (as open-lands at high elevation) and highest richness and variety of use of strata (as sea coasts). However, bird assemblage patterns have particularities in less valuable ecosystems and areas, which also justify their importance for conservation, or at least, prescriptions of low impact uses and activities in the management planning.

The importance of SWF for biodiversity is usually inferred from presence or abundance data for small animals. Although large animals, due to their lower density are less likely to be attributed with SWF, they may depend on these areas to effectively utilize the agricultural landscape matrix. Objectives We followed movements of three avian predator species (northern goshawk, common buzzard, and lesser spotted eagle) in the breeding and post-breeding season to assess their dependence on SWF in agricultural landscapes and to determine the characteristics of woods influencing each species. Methods We compared time spent flying and perching, where perching sites were classified as open space, forest interior, forest edge, and SWF. Next, the relative importance of SWF and forest edges, as well as specific characteristics of each habitat, were evaluated using resource selection functions. Results All species spent most of the daytime perching, and preferentially utilized SWF and forest edges. Buzzards and eagles were not influenced by the characteristics of SWF, but goshawks preferred relatively large, dense patches. Conclusions We conclude that SWF are crucial for exploitation of agricultural landscapes by avian predators by providing suitable perching sites for foraging. We also detected variation in the quality of perching sites, suggesting that for some species (like the goshawk), artificial perching sites cannot compensate for a lack of SWF.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10980-021-01223-9.pdf,link.springer.com,chanting-goshawk,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.67420375316383,"['lesser spotted eagle', 'goshawk', 'common buzzard', 'northern goshawk']",412

Seabird demography and spatial distribution outside of the breeding season are poorly understood, and migratory
stopover and staging sites represent important energetic bottlenecks during the avian annual cycle. We quantified hatch-year Roseate
Tern (Sterna dougallii) weekly residency, weekly recruitment rate into the staging population, and derived weekly staging population
growth rate during two postbreeding, premigratory staging seasons (2014 and 2015) at Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts,
USA. We also estimated hatch-year tern stopover duration at Cape Cod staging grounds. Tern residency probability at Cape Cod
National Seashore during 2014 and 2015 was nearly 1 during the first weeks of the season and decreased steadily over the last 4 weeks
to ~0.5 in the final week of the study. Recruitment rates into the staging population, representing the weekly per capita change in hatch-
year terns present during the staging season, indicated that most terns arrived on the staging grounds during the first weeks of the
staging season (16 July to 19 August). We also identified differences in staging duration between birds from the two breeding regions.
Hatch-year terns from the southernmost region spent less time staging at Cape Cod National Seashore than their northern counterparts
in both 2014 and 2015. These differences may indicate alternative staging strategies for individuals originating in different regions and
possibly reveal differences in resource conditions between these areas, for example, in the availability of ephemeral prey fish.

The problem is compounded when species distributions occur across large spatial extents. Threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) epitomize this problem: their critical habitat encompasses a vast expanse of forest that also supplies much of Canada’s merchantable timber. Boreal caribou were protected under the Canada Species at Risk Act in 2003. We investigated putative drivers of reduced disturbance for caribou habitat since then. Where the cumulative logging footprint slowed within caribou habitat, this has resulted neither from decreases in annual allowable cut of timber nor the creation or expansion of protected areas. Rather, it has fluctuated with the American economy relative to that of Canada. For each $0.05 US lost over the $CAD, 129 km2 of caribou habitat was not disturbed by logging in a given year. Recent population declines have been occurring even though logging typically remained at <70% of allowed levels. Our study raises concerns about how caribou are functionally being conserved under the current application of existing legislation. In this globalized world, the economy of foreign nations is increasingly likely to govern national conservation objectives.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229555&type=printable,journals.plos.org,paille,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.67874228493638,,770

Here, we describe niche partitioning within a sympatry zone in a fragmented Andean landscape between two closely related flush-pursue species: a high-elevation montane forest dweller, (Myioborus melanocephalus), and a mid-elevation montane forest dweller, (M. miniatus). As all flush-pursuers use very similar hunting techniques involving visual displays to flush and pursue insects in air, and benefit from being the “rare predators”, ecological sorting between species in sympatry zones should allow their co-existence. We found that both species occupied vegetation resembling their typical allopatric habitats: a mosaic of pastures, clearings, and shrubs with small proportion of high trees for M. melanocephalus, and dense high forests with high proportion of trees, lower irradiance and higher humidity for M. miniatus. M. melanocephalus often foraged in bushes and at lower heights, whereas M. miniatus often foraged in tree crowns. The two species differed relatively little in their foraging technique.

This breeding strategy requires decisions that may affect the parasite's reproductive success. During the breeding season, cowbirds search for host nests and revisit them to monitor its progress and parasitize at the time host laying begins. When visiting hosts nests, they repeatedly peck the nest contents trying to destroy one or more eggs. This behaviour favours parasite's offspring by reducing the competition for food with nestmates. We evaluated if the egg-pecking behaviour of female shiny (Molothrus bonariensis) and screaming (M. rufoaxillaris) cowbirds is affected by the strength and the size of the eggs they find in the nest. We presented to wild-caught females artificial clutches with two natural eggs that differ in size and shell strength. We found that female shiny and screaming cowbirds adjusted egg-pecking behaviour based on the strength but not on the size of the eggs. When differences in strength between eggs were high, both cowbird species pecked more frequently the egg with the weaker shell, increasing the probability of a successful puncture. Our results indicate that female cowbirds can discriminate eggs through the strength of the shell, and by choosing the weaker egg to peck, they increase the probability of puncturing.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-021-01549-6.pdf,link.springer.com,baywing,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.68376986206462,['molothrus bonariensis'],246

The drivers of such pattern are also poorly known in the southern flank of the Himalaya due to limited studies. Therefore, we assessed the species richness, seasonal patterns and drivers of avian diversity along an elevational gradient on Mardi Himal trekking trail, a newly open tourist route in Annapurna Conservation Area of the central Himalaya. Two surveys (winter and summer seasons of 2019) were conducted from the bank of Seti-Gandaki River confluence (1030 m above sea level, asl) up to the Low Camp (3050 m asl) of the Mardi Himal. The point count method was employed in every 100 m rise in the elevation. Diversity indices were calculated and bird abundance data on species, sites, seasons and environmental variables were analyzed. Generalized linear model, polynomial regression and ordinary least square regression were performed to examine the importance of environmental factors in shaping the avian richness pattern.

Elevation and mean monthly temperature in both seasons showed non-linear relation with avian species richness. Precipitation exhibited positive association in summer whereas the same in winter was negatively correlated with avian species richness. Distance to the nearest water source and the nearest human settlement were negatively correlated with the richness of birds. Small-ranged and insectivorous birds were under the strong influence of gradients on climatic variables like temperature and precipitation.

We performed niche overlap analysis and ecological niche modeling using four machine-learning algorithms to evaluate whether species' ecological niches evolved or remained conserved after the past South American biogeographic events. We found a low niche overlap among the same species populations in the two biomes. However, niche similarity tests showed that, for half of the species, the overlap was higher than the ones generated by our null models. These results lead us to conclude that niche conservatism was not enough to avoid ecological differentiation among species even though detected in many species.

Satellite tracking has been an integral part of identifying the causes for declines in the migratory populations in Europe and Africa, and consequently where conservation efforts should be focussed to halt the decline of “the white scavenger vulture”. The situation, however, is much less clear in central Asia where its migratory populations, numbering an estimated 700–1,300 pairs, are also thought to be declining. There are few data available on population status or trends and nothing is known about their migration routes or wintering sites. While some threats, such as electrocution, are known on the breeding grounds, little is known about the relative importance of threats, their demographic impacts and how these vary during migration. The recent Convention on Migratory Species Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures identified these critical gaps in knowledge as a key priority needing to be addressed. The Central Asian Vultures Project (www.CentralAsianVultures.org) aims to tackle this by satellite tracking Egyptian Vultures originating from the Uzbekistan population where there is estimated to be only 135 breeding pairs and the species is listed in the National Red Data Book.  Uzbekistan is in the middle of the central Asian-Indian flyway with many migrants funnelled through it because of the Caspian Sea in the west and the Hindu Kush range in the east. This flyway ends with Iraq in the west and Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent in the east. The majority of Uzbekistan is covered in desert, with the Kyzylkum Desert at its centre. The semi-arid region is predominantly flat, but does provide some nesting habitat for the Egyptian Vulture in the form of low-lying hills and cliffs along wadi systems. In August 2021, the field team visited three different nests in the regions of Ayakaghytma and Bukantau in central Kyzylkum and satellite tagged four juvenile Egyptian Vultures (read about the birds here). Of the four birds, three transmitted GPS data allowing their movements to be tracked for the first time in Asia. All three birds started migration from Uzbekistan between 5–15th September 2021. Each bird took a different route with two (Arys & Anya) migrating via Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan and ultimately wintering in India (Rajasthan and Haryana). The third bird, Timur, took a very different route making a long journey with several stops through Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and finally arriving in Yemen in late November 2021 (Fig. 1).

In this study, artificial lights placed on the Jacques Cartier bridge in Montreal, Canada were evaluated to determine their impact on insects, insectivorous birds and peregrine falcons. The impact was measured the year the illumination begun and the year following (two years in total). Insect distribution and abundance at three different sites around the bridge was measured. Insectivorous bird abundance and activity were evaluated by observing the cliff swallow as a proxy. Peregrine falcon presence and nesting behavior at the bridge was measured. Insects (aerial and aquatic) were found to be more abundant closer to the illuminated part of the bridge and particularly in the year following the illumination’s beginning. Similarly, cliff swallows were more abundant at the bridge the year following the start of the illumination and their activity was more important closer to the illuminated section. Peregrine falcons were only present at the bridge in the year following the beginning of the illumination and specifically at the illuminated part of the bridge. No nesting was detected. These three groups are connected to each other through a food chain in which insect abundance impacts insectivorous bird abundance, which in turn impacts peregrine falcon presence. The illumination therefore positively impacts these three groups separately and together through their food chain.

Most aging guides consist of descriptions and photographs that are time consuming to read and subjective to interpret. The Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana) is a secondary cavity-nesting passerine that nests in coniferous and open deciduous forests. Nest box programs for cavity-nesting species have provided suitable nesting locations and opportunities for data collection on nestling growth and development. We developed models for predicting the age of Western Bluebird nestlings from morphometric measurements using model training and validation. These were developed for mass, tarsus, and two different culmen measurements. Our models were accurate to within less than a day, and each model worked best for a specific age range. The mass and tarsus models can be used to estimate the ages of Western Bluebird nestlings 0–10 days old and were accurate to within 0.5 days for mass and 0.7 days for tarsus. The culmen models can be used to estimate ages of nestlings 0–15 days old and were also accurate to within less than a day. The daily mean, minimum, and maximum values of each morphometric measurement are provided and can be used in the field for accurate nestling age estimations in real time. The model training and validation procedures used here demonstrate that this method can create aging models that are highly accurate.

Whilst green infrastructure (the network of natural and semi-natural areas in cities) has been studied extensively in terms of specific features that promote biodiversity, there have been no studies that have assessed how species richness in different types of green space (GS) varies with increasing levels of urbanization in the surrounding matrix. We studied the effects of different types of GS and urbanization in the surrounding matrix on bird communities in the mid-sized city of Göttingen, Germany. We used the point-count method for bird observations in allotments and parks. To determine the level of urbanization, we calculated percentage of impervious surfaces around GSs. Increasing levels of urbanization around GSs had no effect on the species richness, functional traits or the community composition of birds. Nevertheless, we found that species richness and functional traits varied according to GS type. Parks had a greater species richness and were found to have more ground nesting and tropical migrant birds compared to allotments. We found more cavity nesting and resident birds in allotments. As different types of GS can contribute to the presence of different species and functional trait variations, their positive effect on bird species richness can be enhanced when they are present together in urban landscapes.

River Yamuna passing through Delhi is a refuge for several resident and migratory species of birds but its water quality has been deteriorating due to ever growing population, contributing most of its pollution load in the urban center. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine whether the occupancy of common waterbirds varied between differential polluted sections of the river, 2) to better understand the associations between habitat variables and use of the river habitat by common waterbirds and 3) to identify whether any species or groups of species could be useful as indicators for habitat quality. The occupancy parameter Ψ was estimated for 17 common resident species among 68 species, recorded from 176 sampling locations during 2018, on the banks of river. Species occupancy was estimated as a function of habitat variables such as physico-chemical characteristic of water, solid waste, percent area of surface and emergent vegetation and human disturbance at each sampling site.

Interestingly, occupancy of Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus) is negatively associated with pH but positively with solid waste strongly suggesting its preference for the polluted sections of the river, possibly due to the increased availability of food. For river Yamuna, estimates of Ψ for various birds forms a baseline to study future trends.

Available knowledge on this species is limited to historic descriptive data with no ecological information provided. Populations continue to dramatically decline in Tunisia, where only one relic population survives. Investigating the breeding biology of this species is essential for conservation purposes. The purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of the Tunisian relic population and provide detailed data on breeding biology over two breeding seasons (2017 and 2018). This study occurred on a private farm of 650 ha, located 10 km from Dhorbania village at Kairouan Governorate, in central Tunisia. Active nests were monitored weekly during egg laying period and twice a week during hatching period. The Ivlev’s electivity index was used to assess whether the frequency of use of nesting trees and bushes matched their availability in the study area. We recorded nest measurements and positions, and compared them using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Variations of breeding parameters as number of eggs laid, hatchlings, and fledglings over years were performed using Mann–Whitney U-test and χ2 tests. We used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to investigate how egg volume varied with clutch size and laying date. We investigated clutch size, egg size, hatching and fledging success, and evaluated how these parameters varied according to laying date and nest characteristics. Clutch size averaged 5.00 ± 0.19 but was significantly greater in 2017. Hatching success was 2.78 ± 0.34 eggs hatched per nest and fledging success reached 1.69 ± 0.30 young/nest. Causes of nest failure included the depredation of nestlings by shrikes, cobras and rats (e.g. Lanius meridionalis, Naja haje and Rattus rattus), death of parents by the Black-shouldered Kite (Elanus caeruleus) and nest parasitism by the Great Spotted Cuckoo (Clamator glandarius). Clutch size, brood size and fledgling success were unaffected by laying date, nest volume and nest elevation. Egg volume decreased with laying date but was unaffected by clutch.

In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09961-9.pdf,nature.com,mixornis,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-6.765838736832464,"['melozone leucotis', 'troglodytes aedon', 'house wren']",9

For the two sympatric Galliformes, Silver Pheasants (Lophura nycthemera) and White-necklaced Partridges (Arborophila gingica), we know little about the role of habitat use and interspecific interactions in modulating their coexistence. We adopted a probabilistic approach incorporating habitat preference and interspecific interaction using occupancy model to account for imperfect detection, and used daily activity pattern analysis to investigate the co-occurrence pattern of these two sympatric Galliformes in wet and dry seasons. We found that the detection probability of Silver Pheasant and White-necklaced Partridge were related to habitat variables and interspecific interaction. The presence of Silver Pheasant increases the detection probability of White-necklaced Partridge in both the wet and dry season. However, the presence of White-necklaced Partridges increases the detection probability of Silver Pheasants in the wet season, but decreases the probability in the dry season. Further, Silver Pheasants were detected frequently in the sites of high values of enhanced vegetable index (EVI) in both the wet and dry season, and in sites away from human residential settlement in the wet season. White-necklaced partridges were mainly detected in low EVI sites. The site use probabilities of two Galliformes were best explained by habitat variables, Silver Pheasants and White-necklaced Partridges preferred steeper areas during the wet and dry season. Both species mainly occurred in low EVI areas during the wet season and occupied sites away from the resident settlement during the dry season. Moreover, the site use probabilities of two species had opposite relationships with forest canopy coverage. Silver Pheasants preferred areas with high forest canopy coverage whereas White-necklaced Partridges preferred low forest canopy coverage in the dry season, and vice versa in the wet season. Species interaction factor (SIF) corroborated weak evidence of the dependence of the site use of one species on that of the other in the either dry or wet season. Temporally, high overlapping of daily activity pattern indicated no significantly temporal niche differentiation between sympatric Galliformes in both wet and dry seasons. Our results demonstrated that the presence of two species influenced the detection probability interactively and there was no temporal partitioning in activity time between Silver Pheasants and White-necklaced Partridges in the wet and dry seasons. The site use probability of two Galliformes was best explained by habitat variables, especially the forest canopy coverage.

Typical crops include maize, cassava and beans, and cash crops such as pigeon pea, soya, cowpea, sunflower and sesame (INE 2014 ).",en,Agricultural expansion in African savannas: effects on diversity and composition of trees and mammals,"Land use change (LUC) is the leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. However, the global understanding of LUC's impact on biodiversity is mainly based on comparisons of land use endpoints (habitat vs non-habitat) in forest ecosystems. Hence, it may not generalise to savannas, which are ecologically distinct from forests, as they are inherently patchy, and disturbance adapted. Endpoint comparisons also cannot inform the management of intermediate mosaic landscapes. We aim to address these gaps by investigating species- and community-level responses of mammals and trees along a gradient of small scale agricultural expansion in the miombo woodlands of northern Mozambique. Thus, the case study represents the most common pathway of LUC and biodiversity change in the world's largest savanna. Tree abundance, mammal occupancy, and tree- and mammal-species richness showed a non-linear relationship with agricultural expansion (characterised by the Land Division Index, LDI). These occurrence and diversity metrics increased at intermediate LDI (0.3 to 0.7), started decreasing beyond LDI > 0.7, and underwent high levels of decline at extreme levels of agricultural expansion (LDI > 0.9). Despite similarities in species richness responses, the two taxonomic groups showed contrasting β-diversity patterns in response to increasing LDI: increased dissimilarity among tree communities (heterogenisation) and high similarity among mammals (homogenisation). Our analysis along a gradient of landscape-scale land use intensification allows a novel understanding of the impacts of different levels of land conversion, which can help guide land use and restoration policy. Biodiversity loss in this miombo landscape was lower than would be inferred from existing global syntheses of biodiversity-land use relations for Africa or the tropics, probably because such syntheses take a fully converted landscape as the endpoint. As, currently, most African savanna landscapes are a mosaic of savanna habitats and small scale agriculture, biodiversity loss is probably lower than in current global estimates, albeit with a trend towards further conversion. However, at extreme levels of land use change (LDI > 0.9 or < 15% habitat cover) miombo biodiversity appears to be more sensitive to LUC than inferred from the meta-analyses. To mitigate the worst effects of land use on biodiversity, our results suggest that miombo landscapes should retain > 25% habitat cover and avoid LDI > 0.75—after which species richness of both groups begin to decline. Our findings indicate that tree diversity may be easier to restore from natural restoration than mammal diversity, which became spatially homogeneous.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10531-021-02249-w.pdf,link.springer.com,miombo,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-6.77295716802937,,280

The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats because of anthropogenic activities are major threats to biodiversity
worldwide. In recent decades, vast mosaics of natural and seminatural habitats have been transformed into fragmented agricultural
landscapes in Inner Mongolia, China, with potential negative effects on avian diversity. We quantified the effect of local and landscape
habitat attributes on the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities in Inner Mongolian grasslands. We
considered eight independent habitat variables obtained by variance inflation factor analysis. We used canonical correspondence analysis
to determine how these habitat factors of multiple scales explained variance in species composition. We then fitted Bayesian generalized
additive models to analyze the habitat-biodiversity relationships and included a smooth effect of land cover richness to test the
intermediate disturbance hypothesis in each model. Our results provided evidence that differences in bird assemblages can be explained,
in part, by differences in local and landscape-scale habitat features. The responses of the four diversity indices to these predictors were
diverse and scale-dependent. We found species richness and Shannon diversity exhibited similar response, with both being negatively
related to bare land percentage while being positively related to plant canopy and impervious surface percentage. Phylogenetic diversity
was positively associated with plant richness while negatively associated with forest percentage and impervious surface percentage. We
found no statistical evidence for a relationship between functional diversity and any of the variables examined here. Additionally, for
the four measures of bird diversity, we did not find any evidence that they peaked at intermediate levels of habitat disturbance. We
propose that assessments of regional grassland bird communities should be conducted at multiple scales and that a range of biodiversity
metrics are required to better evaluate and inform conservation decision making, especially when the target is preserving not only
species but also their evolutionary history and ecological functions.

Satellite tracking has been an integral part of identifying the causes for declines in the migratory populations in Europe and Africa, and consequently where conservation efforts should be focussed to halt the decline of “the white scavenger vulture”. The situation, however, is much less clear in central Asia where its migratory populations, numbering an estimated 700–1,300 pairs, are also thought to be declining. There are few data available on population status or trends and nothing is known about their migration routes or wintering sites. While some threats, such as electrocution, are known on the breeding grounds, little is known about the relative importance of threats, their demographic impacts and how these vary during migration. The recent Convention on Migratory Species Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures identified these critical gaps in knowledge as a key priority needing to be addressed. The Central Asian Vultures Project (www.CentralAsianVultures.org) aims to tackle this by satellite tracking Egyptian Vultures originating from the Uzbekistan population where there is estimated to be only 135 breeding pairs and the species is listed in the National Red Data Book.  Uzbekistan is in the middle of the central Asian-Indian flyway with many migrants funnelled through it because of the Caspian Sea in the west and the Hindu Kush range in the east. This flyway ends with Iraq in the west and Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent in the east. The majority of Uzbekistan is covered in desert, with the Kyzylkum Desert at its centre. The semi-arid region is predominantly flat, but does provide some nesting habitat for the Egyptian Vulture in the form of low-lying hills and cliffs along wadi systems. In August 2021, the field team visited three different nests in the regions of Ayakaghytma and Bukantau in central Kyzylkum and satellite tagged four juvenile Egyptian Vultures (read about the birds here). Of the four birds, three transmitted GPS data allowing their movements to be tracked for the first time in Asia. All three birds started migration from Uzbekistan between 5–15th September 2021.

This study is the first to examine the movements of Shoebills (Balaeniceps rex), an iconic and vulnerable bird species. Using GPS transmitters deployed on six immature and one adult Shoebills over a 5-year period, during which four immatures matured into adults, we analyse their home ranges and distances moved in the Bangweulu Wetlands, Zambia. We relate their movements at the start of the rainy season (October to December) to changes in Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), a proxy for surface water.

However, average annual home ranges were large, with high individual variability, but were similar between age classes. Immature and adult Shoebills responded differently to changes in surface water; sites that adults abandoned became drier, while sites abandoned by immatures became wetter. However, there were no differences in NDWI of areas used by Shoebills before abandonment and newly selected sites, suggesting that Shoebills select areas with similar surface water. We hypothesise that the different responses to changes in surface water by immature and adult Shoebills are related to age-specific optimal foraging conditions and fishing techniques.

Background: The Maghreb Magpie (Pica mauritanica) is an endemic North African species. Available knowledge on 
this species is limited to historic descriptive data with no ecological information provided. Populations continue to 
dramatically decline in Tunisia, where only one relic population survives. Investigating the breeding biology of this 
species is essential for conservation purposes. The purpose of this study was to increase our understanding of the 
Tunisian relic population and provide detailed data on breeding biology over two breeding seasons (2017 and 2018).
Methods: This study occurred on a private farm of 650 ha, located 10 km from Dhorbania village at Kairouan Gov-
ernorate, in central Tunisia. Active nests were monitored weekly during egg laying period and twice a week during 
hatching period. The Ivlev’s electivity index was used to assess whether the frequency of use of nesting trees and 
bushes matched their availability in the study area. We recorded nest measurements and positions, and compared 
them using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Variations of breeding parameters as number of eggs laid, hatchlings, and 
fledglings over years were performed using Mann–Whitney U-test and χ2 tests. We used a Generalized Linear Mixed 
Model (GLMM) to investigate how egg volume varied with clutch size and laying date.
Results: We investigated clutch size, egg size, hatching and fledging success, and evaluated how these parameters 
varied according to laying date and nest characteristics. Clutch size averaged 5.00 ± 0.19 but was significantly greater 
in 2017. Hatching success was 2.78 ± 0.34 eggs hatched per nest and fledging success reached 1.69 ± 0.30 young/
nest. Causes of nest failure included the depredation of nestlings by shrikes, cobras and rats (e.g. Lanius meridionalis, 
Naja haje and Rattus rattus), death of parents by the Black-shouldered Kite (Elanus caeruleus) and nest parasitism by 
the Great Spotted Cuckoo (Clamator glandarius). Clutch size, brood size and fledgling success were unaffected by lay-
ing date, nest volume and nest elevation. Egg volume decreased with laying date but was unaffected by clutch.
Conclusion: Our study provides the first and only detailed data on reproductive parameters of the Maghreb Magpie 
in its entire geographic range (North Africa). Information gleaned from this study provides valuable information for 
monitoring and long-term conservation plans of the endangered Tunisian Magpie population. Additionally, our data 
provide an avenue of large-scale comparative studies of the reproductive ecology of the magpie complex.

Here we reviewed 10,090 abstracts and extracted data from 71 studies reported in 58 relevant publications, to assess quantitatively whether phenotypic trait changes associated with climate change are adaptive in animals. A meta-analysis focussing on birds, the taxon best represented in our dataset, suggests that global warming has not systematically affected morphological traits, but has advanced phenological traits. We demonstrate that these advances are adaptive for some species, but imperfect as evidenced by the observed consistent selection for earlier timing.

Additionally, the relationship between population dynamics and the offspring size and number allocation is far less understood. We investigate whether resource allocation between egg size and clutch size is influenced by the ambient temperature and whether it may be related to apparent nest survival rate. We measured 1548 eggs from 541 nests of two closely related shorebird species, the Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and the White-faced Plover (C. dealbatus) in China, in four populations that exhibit contrasting ambient environments. We weighed females, monitored nest survival, and calculated the variance of ambient temperature. Although we found that egg size and clutch size were all different between the four breeding populations, the reproductive investment (i.e. total clutch volume) was similar between populations. We also found that populations with a high survival rate had relatively larger eggs and a smaller clutch than populations with a low nest survival rate.

However, little is known about how local characteristics and spatial location are related to biodiversity inhabiting SPUGS in tropical cities. In this study, we aimed at assess how noise, vegetation aspects (local characteristics), distance from a major habitat patch and from water (spatial location) are related to the bird community (species composition, species richness, total abundance and feeding guilds) inhabiting SPUGS in a medium-sized Neotropical city (Rio Claro, Brazil). We expected local characteristics to be the most important variables influencing the bird community. Bird observations were conducted in 28 SPUGS (< 1 ha) and we used generalized linear models and a multi-model inference to assess the relationships between SPUGS’ attributes and the bird community. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess which SPUGS characteristics modulate species composition. We made 1,808 records of 75 bird species distributed in 26 families. Noise was negatively related to bird species richness, total abundance, and abundance of granivorous species. On the other hand, tree species richness presented positive relationships with bird species richness and total abundance. Noise and tree species richness also were responsible for modulating the composition of species inhabiting SPUGS. Therefore, we demonstrated that local characteristics modulate birds inhabiting SPUGS; while noise is a strong limiting factor for birds inhabiting these small green spaces, increasing tree species richness can enhance SPUGS’ ability in harboring a diverse bird community.

Results Communities were most similar between landscapes that had high agricultural coverage and became more dissimilar as their respective landscapes differed more strongly in the amount of agriculture. Community dissimilarity increased with geographic distance up to about 200 km. Dissimilarity with increasing agriculture was largely due to the disappearance of Neotropical migrants, insectivores and foliage-gleaners from the community as agriculture increased.

For example, it can be useful for synchronizing nest visits with events of particular interest, such as the age at which young can be safely ringed, or in choosing the best period to attain the most accurate calculation of laying or hatching dates. We constructed a photographic guide for aging European Bee-eaters (Merops apiaster) nestlings to 3-day age classes and evaluated the aging method by performing a validation exercise with several observers with no previous experience in aging bee-eater nestlings. The aging guide for bee-eater nestlings allowed estimating age to within 3 days with an average accuracy of 0.85. We found the optimal period for aging nestlings was between days 13‒18 (with accuracy between 0.94 and 0.99), during which the status of feather development was more easily distinguishable from the preceding and subsequent age classes. During the first 3 days after hatching, nestlings could also be aged with high accuracy (0.93). The small size of the nestling in relation to the eggs and the nestling’s inability to raise its head during these first days allowed for good discrimination from the subsequent age class. Between days 25 and 28, nestlings were correctly aged in only half of assignments (0.55 sensitivity) and nestlings belonging to class 7 (days 7‒9) were the least correctly identified (0.38 sensitivity).

The most affected species were Common Raven (Corvus corax) and Upland Buzzard (Buteo hemilasius), highlighting the electrocution of 5 endangered Saker Falcons (Falco cherrug). By contrast, we only recorded 8 individuals of 5 species colliding with wires, the most affected being Pallas’s Sandgrouse (Syrrhaptes paradoxus). About 76.1% of sampled poles had some mitigation measure. Of these, 96.6% were brush perch deflectors and 3.4% rotating-mirrors perch deterrents. We found differences in electrocution rates among crossarm configurations, with the strain insulator with one jumper being the most lethal. Additionally, we found no correlation between bird abundance and electrocution rates, suggesting that some species are more sensitive to electrocution. Although no differences in total bird electrocution rates were detected between poles with and without perch deterrents, when bird size is considered, deterrents reduced the mortality rate of small birds, while they were ineffective for medium-sized birds. Despite the widespread use of perch deterrents in the Mongolian power line network, there is still an alarming electrocution rate. This strategy is ineffective and some mechanisms, such as brush perch deflectors, may increase the electrocution rate for some medium-sized birds. Finally, we propose strategies to minimize the avian electrocution rate in the Gobi Desert.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00277-2,avianres.biomedcentral.com,sandgrouse,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.83891640148694,"['syrrhaptes paradoxus', 'buteo hemilasius', 'saker', 'corvus corax', 'falco cherrug', 'common raven', 'upland buzzard']",242

Previous modelling studies using long-term data have suggested that neonicotinoid application has had a detrimental impact on bird populations, but these studies were either limited to a single species or neglected to analyse specific exposure pathways in conjunction with observed population trends. Using bird abundance data, neonicotinoid usage records and cropping data for England at a 5x5 km resolution, generalised linear mixed models were used to test for spatio-temporal associations between neonicotinoid use and changes in the populations of 22 farmland bird species between 1994 and 2014, and to determine whether any associations were explained by dietary preferences. We assigned farmland bird species to three categories of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids based on literature data for species diets and neonicotinoid residues present in dietary items. Significant estimates of neonicotinoid-related population change were obtained for 13 of the 22 species (9 positive effects, 4 negative effects). Model estimates for individual species were not collectively explained by dietary risk categories, so dietary exposure to neonicotinoids via ingestion of treated seeds and seedlings could not be confirmed as a causal factor in farmland bird declines. Although it is not possible to infer any generic effect of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids on farmland bird populations, our analysis identifies three species with significant negative estimates that may warrant further research (house sparrow Passer domesticus, skylark Alauda arvensis and red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa). We conclude that there was either no consistent effect of dietary exposure to neonicotinoids on farmland bird populations in England, or that any over-arching effect was not detectable using our study design.

Background: Animals need to adjust their vigilance strategies when foraging between physically contrasting veg-
etated and non-vegetated habitats. Vegetated habitats may pose a greater risk for some if vegetation characteristics 
function as a visual obstruction but benefit others if they serve as protective shelter. Variation in group size, presence 
of similar species, along with variation in environmental conditions and anthropogenic disturbance can also influence 
vigilance investment.
Methods: In this study, we quantified the vigilance behaviour of two large-bodied, sympatric migratory curlew 
species—Far Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) and Eurasian Curlew (N. arquata)—in vegetated Suaeda 
salsa saltmarsh and non-vegetated mudflat habitat in Liaohekou National Nature Reserve, China. We used linear 
mixed models to examine the effects of habitat type, season, tide time, flock size (conspecific and heterospecific), and 
human disturbance on curlew vigilance investment.
Results: Both species spent a higher percentage of time under visual obstruction in S. salsa habitat compared to 
mudflat habitat but in response, only Far Eastern Curlew increased their percentage of vigilance time, indicating that 
visual obstruction in this habitat is only a concern for this species. There was no evidence that S. salsa vegetation 
served as a form of cryptic background colouration since neither species decreased their vigilance effect in S. salsa 
habitat in spring compared to the autumn migration season. The effect of curlew social environment (i.e. flock size) 
was habitat dependent since percentage of vigilance time by curlews in saltmarsh increased with both the number of 
individual curlews and number of other birds present, but not in mudflat habitat.

Although hosts of Old World cuckoos (Cuculidae) often show geographic variation in egg rejection behavior, cowbird hosts typically exhibit uniform responses of all acceptance or all rejection of cowbird eggs. Thus, geographic variation in cowbird parasitism frequencies might reflect a different behavioral response to parasitism by hosts where only some populations reject parasitism. In this study, we tested whether egg rejection behavior may explain the lack of parasitism observed in our eastern red-wing population, which may provide insight into low parasitism levels across eastern North America. We parasitized red-wing nests with model cowbird eggs to determine their response to parasitism. Nests were tested across three nest stages and compared to control nests with no manipulations. Because rejection differed significantly by stage, we compared responses separately for each nest stage. We also monitored other songbird nests to identify parasitism frequencies on all potential hosts. Red-wings showed significantly more rejections during the building stage, but not for the laying and incubation stages. Rejections during nest building involved mostly egg burials, which likely represent a continuation of the nest building process rather than true rejection of the cowbird egg. Excluding these responses, red-wings rejected 15% of cowbird eggs, which is similar to rejection levels from other studies and populations. The overall parasitism frequency on 11 species surveyed in our study area was only 7.4%. Egg rejection behavior does not explain the lack of parasitism on red-wings in our eastern population. Alternatively, we suggest that cowbird preference for other hosts and the low abundance of cowbirds in the east might explain the lack of parasitism. Future research should also explore cowbird and host density and the makeup of the host community to explain the low levels of parasitism on red-wings across eastern North America because egg rejection alone is unlikely to explain this broad geographic trend.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0186-1,avianres.biomedcentral.com,thrasher,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.85839772439463,"['molothrus ater', 'agelaius phoeniceus']",846

We develop methods to assess the extent to which biotas are geographically discrete, and find that transition zones between regions occupied by tropical-associated or temperate-associated biotas are often narrow, suggesting a role for freezing temperatures in partitioning global biotas. Across the steepest tropical-temperate gradient in the world, that of the Himalaya, bird communities below and above the freezing line are largely populated by different tropical and temperate biotas with links to India and Southeast Asia, or to China respectively. The importance of the freezing line is retained when clades rather than species are considered, reflecting confinement of different clades to one or another climate zone. The reality of the sharp tropical-temperate boundary adds credence to the argument that exceptional species richness in the tropics reflects species accumulation over time, with limited transgressions of species and clades into the temperate. Multiple drivers maintain unique species assemblages at multiple biogeographic scales.

We recorded the density of seeds left on the soil surface, bird density, and consumption of pesticide-treated seed by birds using camera traps. We calculated the dose ingested by each bird species in a single feeding bout and if they ate treated seeds exclusively for 1 day. We extrapolated this for an additional 19 pesticides commonly used as seed treatments, assuming equal consumption rates. All three fields contained grains on the soil surface (mean 7.14 seeds/m2 on sowing day). In total, 1,374 granivorous birds spanning 18 different species were observed in the fields, with 11 species filmed eating the seeds. Fludioxonil appears to pose a low risk to birds, with <1.14% of the LD50 potentially ingested by a bird for a daily maximum amount of seeds. Analysis of the further 19 pesticides commonly used as seed dressings suggests that the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam represent the highest risk for granivorous birds. For example, chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) could consume 63% of LD50 of imidacloprid in a single feeding bout, and 370% in a day. Further investigation is clearly required to determine whether seeds treated with these other pesticides are consumed as readily as those treated with fludioxonil, as if so this is likely to cause significant harm.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-021-17097-y.pdf,link.springer.com,cannelle,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.86480145378796,"['chaffinch', 'fringilla coelebs']",156

Here we investigated the territorial behavior of male Lined Seedeaters Sporophila lineola, an intra-tropical migrant, during the breeding season (December–May) 2018/2019 in south-eastern Brazil. The Lined Seedeater is a sexually color-dimorphic species that inhabits open areas and feeds on seeds. We followed 18 color-banded individuals, during the period in which they had an active nest.

Males exhibited agonistic behavior whenever another male intrudes on their territories, especially if in the vicinity of their nests. Our observations indicate that male Lined Seedeaters defend small territories of exclusive use during the breeding season, but forage over a wider home range shared with other conspecifics.

Objectives We explore patterns of avian diversity and abundance in heterogenous landscapes using a novel integration of multiple dimensional gradients of human-mediated modification. Methods We attempt to identify aspects of landscape heterogeneity driving patterns of avian diversity and abundance in agro-urban–rural systems. Specifically, we utilize an intuitive multi-dimensional gradient distinguishing between two axes of human-influence, variation in the built environment (hard–soft) and in agricultural development (green–brown). We use these as covariates in community N-mixture models to describe variation in species abundance and diversity. Results Avian richness was greatest in more heterogeneous regions of the landscape. Responses of individual species were variable, with sensitive species declining, while generalist species increased, leading to higher overall diversity in human-dominated regions. Conclusions Species abundance and diversity is maximized in more heterogeneous parts of landscape mosaics. By characterizing distinct axes of human influence that capture spectrum of land use, we can identify differential effects confounded in traditional landscape metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that multi-dimensional landscape gradients provide a more nuanced understanding of how patterns of biodiversity emerge.

After controlling for latitudinal and evolutionary patterns, we find that migratory birds and mammals have faster paces of life than their non-migratory relatives. Among swimming and walking species, migrants tend to have larger body size, while among flying species, migrants are smaller. We discuss whether pace of life is a determinant, consequence, or adaptive outcome, of migration.

Using geolocators and satellite tracking devices, we demonstrate for the first time that Common Redshanks (Tringa totanus) and Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus) wintering in Singapore can directly fly over the Himalayas to reach breeding grounds in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and north-central Russia respectively. The results also show that migratory shorebirds wintering in Southeast Asia can use both the Central Asian Flyway and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. For Redshanks, westerly-breeding birds crossed the Himalayas while more easterly breeders on the Plateau migrated east of the Himalayas. For Whimbrels, an individual that crossed the Himalayas was probably from a breeding population that was different from the others that migrated along the coast up the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The minimum required altitude of routes of trans-Himalayan Redshanks were no higher on average than those of eastern migrants, but geolocator temperature data indicate that birds departing Singapore flew at high elevations even when not required to by topography, suggesting that the Himalayan mountain range may be less of a barrier than assumed.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77897-z.pdf,nature.com,demoiselle,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.87384568734499,"['tadorna ferruginea', 'tringa totanus', 'anser indicus', 'anthropoides virgo', 'numenius phaeopus']",495

In the conditions of intensive agriculture, the agrophytocenosis structure and features of the agricultural cultivation technology serve as key factors for the differentiation of bird communities in the steppe agricultural landscape. A relatively high specific richness characterizes bird communities of virgin pastures, while among field agrocenoses, i.e., in the areas seeded with perennial grass, the population is much poorer in the grain fields, which are prevalent in the area of agricultural landscapes and, especially, in fields of cultivated crops. During the period of agricultural stability, both the living conditions and the bird community structure in the agricultural landscape remained relatively constant from year to year. The economic crisis that took place at the end of the 20th century caused a deep decline in agricultural production, namely, a decrease in livestock and a reduction in the area of land sown. The restorative successions of vegetation in pastures and fallow lands led to significant changes in the conditions of bird habitats. For many species these changes meant an increase in the ecological capacity of the environment and contributed to the growth of their populations in the agricultural landscape (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758; Motacilla flava Linnaeus, 1758; Coturnix coturnix (Linnaeus, 1758); Tetrax tetrax (Linnaeus, 1758), etc.). The opposite tendency for reduction in numbers is demonstrated by species that avoid high closed grass stands (Melanocorypha leucoptera (Pallas, 1811), Oenanthe oenanthe (Linnaeus, 1758), and O. isabellina (Temminck, 1820), etc.). In general, the community density in the agricultural landscape increased by 2.3 times as compared to the precrisis period, and the number of nesting species increased by 1.3 times. For the species that had formed strong ecological connections with agriculture (primarily, the Corvidae family Рiса рiсa (Linnaeus, 1758); Corvus monedula Linnaeus, 1758; C. frugilegus Linnaeus, 1758; C. cornix Linnaeus, 1758), the decline in the agricultural production and the reduction of functioning agrocenoses had opposite consequences and caused the decline in their numbers in the agricultural landscape.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1062359019100170.pdf,link.springer.com,isabelline,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-6.88030548747458,"['motacilla flava', 'corvus monedula', 'tetrax tetrax', 'coturnix coturnix', 'oenanthe oenanthe', 'melanocorypha leucoptera', 'alauda arvensis']",789

Notably, there has been no robust global test of this prediction&nbsp;for islands where speciation cannot be ignored9, because neither the appropriate data nor the analytical tools have been available. Here we address both deficiencies to reveal, for island birds, the empirical shape of the general relationships that determine how colonization, extinction and speciation rates co-vary with the area and isolation of islands. We compiled a global molecular phylogenetic dataset of birds on islands, based on the terrestrial avifaunas of 41&nbsp;oceanic archipelagos worldwide (including 596&nbsp;avian taxa), and applied a new analysis method to estimate the sensitivity of island-specific rates of colonization, speciation and extinction to island features (area and isolation). Our model predicts—with high explanatory power—several global relationships. We found a decline in colonization with isolation, a decline in extinction with area and an increase in speciation with area and isolation. Combining the theoretical foundations of island biogeography7,8 with the temporal information contained in molecular phylogenies10 proves a powerful approach to reveal the fundamental relationships that govern variation in biodiversity across the planet.

This study is the first to present data on the migratory movements of the “large-billed” subspecies, F. a. naumanni, that breeds in the high Arctic and which has significantly larger body size than those farther south. During 2013–2015, migration tracks were collected from nine adult puffins (6 males and 3 females) tagged with geolocators in northwest Greenland. Overall, female puffins traveled farther than males on their annual migration, with one female puffin traveling over 13,600 km, which was nearly a third farther than any tagged male in our study. Differential migration was observed in migratory phenology and route, with males using a form of chain migration with acute synchrony between individuals while females appeared to largely use leap-frog migration and showed little synchrony between individuals. Extreme sexual segregation in wintering areas was evidenced by two females that migrated to the southern limit of the species’ range while the six males remained at the northern limit, and wintered along the sea ice edge during portions of the non-breeding season. Male puffins thus wintered in regions with sea surface temperatures up to 10° C cooler than female puffins, and in areas with generally colder sea surface temperatures when compared to previously known wintering areas of temperate and low Arctic puffin breeding populations. The degree to which body size enables male F. a. naumanni to remain in colder waters likely reflects differing life history constraints between sexes and populations (i.e., subspecies). Further study is warranted to investigate how recent changes in climate have further exacerbated the observed differences between sexes in high Arctic puffins and possibly other marine avian species.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252055&type=printable,journals.plos.org,puffin,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.88240983510174,"['puffin', 'atlantic puffin', 'fratercula arctica']",327

These calls exhibited a combination of vocal traits of both Oriental Cuckoo (Cuculus optatus) and Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) advertising calls, and some authors therefore suggested that the enigmatic calls were produced by either Common × Oriental Cuckoo male hybrids or Common Cuckoo males having a gene mutation. However, the exact identity of calling birds are still unknown. We recorded previously unknown male-like calls from three captive Oriental Cuckoo females, and compared these calls with enigmatic vocalizations recorded in the wild as well as with advertising vocalizations of Common and Oriental Cuckoo males. To achieve this, we measured calls automatically. Besides, we video-recorded captive female emitting male-like calls, and compared these recordings with the YouTube recordings of calling males of both Common and Oriental Cuckoos to get insight into the mechanism of call production. The analysis showed that female male-like calls recorded in captivity were similar to enigmatic calls recorded in the wild. Therefore, Oriental Cuckoo females might produce the latter calls. Two features of these female calls appeared to be unusual among birds. First, females produced male-like calls at the time of spring and autumn migratory activity and on migration in the wild. Because of this, functional significance of this call remained puzzling. Secondly, the male-like female call unexpectedly combined features of both closed-mouth (closed beak and simultaneous inflation of the ‘throat sac’) and open-mouth (prominent harmonic spectrum and the maximum neck extension observed at the beginning of a sound) vocal behaviors. The Cuculus vocalizations outside the reproductive season remain poorly understood. Here, we found for the first time that Oriental Cuckoo females can produce male-like calls in that time. Because of its rarity, this call might be an atavism. Indeed, female male-like vocalizations are still known in non-parasitic tropical and apparently more basal cuckoos only.

These events co-occurred with the most powerful marine heatwave on record that persisted through 2014–2016 and created an enormous volume of ocean water (the “Blob”) from California to Alaska with temperatures that exceeded average by 2–3 standard deviations. Other studies indicate that this prolonged heatwave reduced phytoplankton biomass and restructured zooplankton communities in favor of lower-calorie species, while it simultaneously increased metabolically driven food demands of ectothermic forage fish. In response, forage fish quality and quantity diminished. Similarly, large ectothermic groundfish were thought to have increased their demand for forage fish, resulting in greater top-predator demands for diminished forage fish resources.

Several studies have shown that the Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is strongly favored by large-scale
disturbances, including forest fires. However, natural disturbances have largely disappeared from European boreal forests because of
modern forestry practices and fire suppression. We currently lack knowledge on the foraging activity and resource use of the Eurasian
Three-toed Woodpecker, especially in burned forests, and this restricts our ability to develop strategies for sustainable forest management
and ecological restoration aiming at improving the situation of this woodpecker and associated species. In order to fill this knowledge
gap, we studied the characteristics of selected foraging substrates and the foraging behavior of the Three-toed Woodpecker during the
breeding season in unburned forests and forests that have been subjected to prescribed burning. We used instantaneous sampling during
two consecutive springs (2016-2017), where we observed the woodpeckers’ foraging behavior during a total of 977 minutes in burned
forest and 962 minutes in unburned forests. The preferred foraging substrate for Three-toed Woodpeckers in both burned and unburned
forests can be characterized as freshly dead trees with a DBH > 15 cm. However, data on time spent foraging on different substrates
suggest that also substrates in the 5-15 DBH range and living trees are important. Additionally, prescribed burnings led to less
pronounced selection of tree species, which suggest that fire may reduce differences in abundance of saproxylic insect prey between
tree species. This information on substrate selection and foraging time provide complementary knowledge and thus should be used
simultaneously when management strategies for improved woodpecker habitat are developed. Our results suggest that both prescribed
burning and protecting forests with high density and diversity of dead wood provides habitat opportunities for Three-toed Woodpeckers
and using both in management may maximize conservation outcome.",https://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art6/ACE-ECO-2019-1477.pdf,ace-eco.org,tridactyle,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-6.90285818008816,['picoides tridactylus'],782

We assessed changes in Rudd’s Lark population and habitat condition over 12 years, within a core section of an area intensively surveyed in 2002–2004. Our 2016 survey found lower absolute numbers of Rudd’s Larks (five transects with Rudd’s Lark present compared to nine in 2002; nine individuals compared to 32), as well as a lower probability of encounter. Transects with shorter grass and higher altitude had a higher probability of Rudd’s Larks occurrence, consistent with findings in 2002. Point locations where Rudd’s Larks were recorded had shorter grass, higher forb cover and more bare ground cover, and tended to be at higher altitudes than random locations in the surrounding grassland. Remotely-sensed fire data showed that late-season fires, which pose a threat to Rudd’s Lark nestling survival, are generally uncommon. Field observations indicated that seven transects (of which two previously contained Rudd’s Lark) that had previously been grassland had been converted to intensive crop production. While Rudd’s Lark may be affected by direct loss of grassland habitat through conversion to crops, the species has also declined within remaining grassland habitat. The drivers of decline remain unclear but this recent observed local decline of Rudd’s Lark in the immediate Wakkerstroom area supports the species’ recent IUCN uplisting to globally ‘Endangered’, given that its previous downlisting was based on habitat requirements and breeding success from this area.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EAC1E4C7332F5A9BC0B7FC4C5736430C/S095927091900011Xa.pdf/div-class-title-declines-of-the-globally-threatened-rudd-s-lark-span-class-italic-heteromirafra-ruddi-span-in-one-of-its-last-remaining-strongholds-div.pdf,cambridge.org,rudd,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.91375024523155,['heteromirafra ruddi'],1085

To characterize the genetic structure of this population we used microsatellite markers from ten loci. Blood samples were collected from 57 chicks directly in the nests during the ongoing monitoring program. We performed a comparative analysis of the obtained data with the existing data from three native populations from French Pyrenees, Croatia, and Israel. We have assessed the genetic differentiation between different native populations and determined the existence of two genetic clusters that differentiate the populations from the Balkan and Iberian Peninsulas. Furthermore, we analysed whether the recent bottleneck events influenced the genetic structure of the populations studied, and we found that all native populations experienced a recent bottleneck event, and that the population of Israel was the least affected. Nevertheless, the parameters of genetic diversity suggest that all analysed populations have retained a similar level of genetic diversity and that the Griffon vulture population from Serbia exhibits the highest value for private alleles.

The concept of “flyway”, which refers to all areas covered by the breeding, nonbreeding, and migrating of birds, provides a framework for international cooperation for conservation. In the same flyway, however, the migratory activities of the same species can differ substantially between seasons and populations. Clarifying the seasonal and population differences in migration is helpful for understanding migration ecology and for identifying conservation gaps. Using satellite-tracking we tracked the migration of Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus variegatus) from nonbreeding sites at Moreton Bay (MB) and Roebuck Bay (RB) in Australia in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. Mantel tests were used to analyze the strength of migration connectivity between the nonbreeding and breeding sites of MB and RB populations. Welch’s t test was used to compare the migration activities between the two populations and between northward and southward migration. During northward migration, migration distance and duration were longer for the MB population than for the RB population. The distance and duration of the first leg flight during northward migration were longer for the MB population than for the RB population, suggesting that MB individuals deposited more fuel before departing from nonbreeding sites to support their longer nonstop flight. The RB population exhibited weaker migration connectivity (breeding sites dispersing over a range of 60 longitudes) than the MB population (breeding sites concentrating in a range of 5 longitudes in Far Eastern Russia). Compared with MB population, RB population was more dependent on the stopover sites in the Yellow Sea and the coastal regions in China, where tidal habitat has suffered dramatic loss. However, RB population increased while MB population decreased over the past decades, suggesting that loss of tidal habitat at stopover sites had less impact on the Whimbrel populations, which can use diverse habitat types. Different trends between the populations might be due to the different degrees of hunting pressure in their breeding grounds. This study highlights that conservation measures can be improved by understanding the full annual life cycle of movements of multiple populations of Whimbrels and probably other migratory birds.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00210-z,avianres.biomedcentral.com,chir,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.92110830037001,"['numenius phaeopus', 'whimbrel']",645

Thus, birds optimally refuel their subsequent migratory flight by reducing stopover duration or foraging activity in food-rich environments. In coastal habitats, birds may forego refueling and take short stopovers irrespective of local food availability. Given the paucity of studies exploring how migrants adjust stopover behavior in response to temporal variation in food availability, especially in the Neotropics, we fixed radio tags to 51 Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceous) over two years at two sites on the coast of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. We applied VHF radio tags during the fall of 2016 and 2017, and tracked birds using automatic and manual receiving units. We estimated stopover duration and activity levels (one site only) for between six and fifteen birds, depending on site and year. We measured fruit availability weekly along the net lanes where we captured birds. We used a generalized linear model to estimate the relationships between stopover duration/activity level and fruit density, bird body mass and year. We interpreted relationships for the model with the lowest AICc value. We found that approximately half of the birds departed on the same day they were captured. For the birds that stayed longer, we could not discern whether they did so because they were light, or fruit density was high. On the other hand, lighter birds were more active than heavier birds but only in one of the two years. Given our results, it is unlikely that Red-eyed Vireos refuel along the Yucatan coast. However, they still likely need to recuperate from crossing the Gulf of Mexico, which may necessitate foraging more often if in poor body condition. If the birds then move inland then stopover should be thought of as a large-scale phenomenon, where habitats with different functions may be spread out over a broad landscape.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00299-w,avianres.biomedcentral.com,vireo,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.92136697743245,['vireo olivaceus'],151

The examination of nearly 4,000 wood pigeon crops suggests that, contrary to the general belief of farmers, wood pigeons do not eat the 'heart' or buds of clover plants ; they eat the leaves and not the buds. Nor do they normally eat young corn but only the seed. During the mild winter of January and February 1943, wild fruits like ivy berries, haws and acorns were found in the 393 crops examined, whereas during the more normal winter of January and February 1942 (131 crops examined) the main food was shown to be cultivated clover. With the co-operation of phenologists a record is being made of the local variations in the abundance of acorn crops, because this seems to be the controlling factor for the movements of the wood pigeon flocks in Great Britain in winter. This might influence forestry work. The food habits of the smaller stock dove are shown to differ. This bird does not take the same food as the wood pigeon: it appears to be more of a ground-feeding species, living almost entirely upon cereals, weed seeds and roots.

Between the 1920s and 1960s, attempts to eradicate the flies from many parts of the country resulted in the slaughter of 1.3 million game animals and extensive bush clearance, which permanently destroyed wildlife habitat. By the early 1970s, the use of insecticides had largely replaced these drastic techniques, but this, in its turn, with the environmental side-effects, caused much concern amongst wildlife conservationists. The authors review the history of tsetse control and discuss the new, safer methods that have been developed, as well as others still under trial. It is clear, however, that tsetse eradication will continue to be controversial. The development of safer and environmentally acceptable techniques does not solve a more fundamental problem—the wise use of Africa's land. Clearing the land of tsetse can open the path to its ruin by unsustainable pastoral encroachment. It is of interest that in April 1985, the EEC governments forced the EEC Commission to modify its forthcoming programme of tsetse fly eradication in four countries by insisting that environmentally harmful methods using DDT should not be employed. The Commission was also forced to include a three-year project on area development planning—land-use considerations were originally not included in its proposals.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/6F532B67FD4423180B27CEDC6A2BECFD/S003060530002562Xa.pdf/div-class-title-the-impact-of-tsetse-fly-control-campaigns-on-african-wildlife-div.pdf,cambridge.org,l'adamaoua,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-6.92427067168488,,746

Egrets are colonially nesting wetland birds that often overlap and can therefore be expected to compete in roosting and nesting habitat as well as in diet. According to the niche partitioning hypothesis, it is to be expected that these similar species would show differentiation in at least one of the main niche dimensions to reduce competition. We tested niche partitioning between the colonially nesting Little Egret (Egretta garzetta) and Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) in temporal, spatial and trophic dimensions. Field study was conducted in three mixed egret colonies in Yangxian County, southwest Shaanxi Province, central China. For each nest colony we recorded its spatial location, the height of nesting trees and of nests, the height of roosting trees and of roosting individuals within the trees. We determined the first egg-laying and first hatching dates of the two species. Craw dissection of storm-killed egret nestlings was used to measure the diet. Six transects were surveyed to study foraging habitat selection. We found that hatching time of Little Egrets peaked earlier (by about 1 month) than that of Cattle Egrets. Cattle Egrets nested and roosted higher than Little Egrets. The foraging habitats used by Little Egrets were dominated by river banks (73.49%), followed by paddy fields (13.25%) and reservoirs (10.84%), whereas Cattle Egret foraging sites were characterized by grasslands (44.44%), paddy fields (33.33%) and river banks (22.22%). Little Egrets consumed more fishes (65.66%) and Odonata larvae (13.69%) than Cattle Egrets, while Cattle Egrets were found feeding mainly on Coleoptera (29.69%) and Orthoptera (23.29%). Little Egrets preyed on larger mean biomasses of food items than Cattle Egrets. Our results confirm the niche partitioning hypothesis as a mechanism for coexistence among ecologically similar species. In two coexisting egret species, niche partitioning is multidimensional, such that the two coexistent species occupy differing ecological space based on all three temporal, spatial and trophic niche dimensions.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00264-7,avianres.biomedcentral.com,goliath,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.93977468009036,"['egretta garzetta', 'bubulcus ibis', 'cattle egret', 'little egret']",305

Worryingly, the invasive dove is a known reservoir of many diseases, some of which can potentially infect mammals (including human beings). Additionally, aggressive behaviors have been recorded toward other bird species resulting in territory and nest usurpation. Thus, the presence of this species poses an important risk for native species with similar habits, particularly in insular systems. Based on this, we carried out this study to assess the density and distribution of the Eurasian Collared-Dove in the island of Cozumel, as well as to evaluate the relationship between their abundance and the environmental characteristics of the places they inhabit. We estimated their distance-corrected densities in the island's largest town and performed an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation to visualize their distribution.

Predators can respond to chemically defended prey in multiple ways, the predator psychology approach to predation often treats predation as a general process despite the possibility for multiple responses among species. The effectiveness of a prey’s chemical defense at reducing predation might also vary depending on what predator is attacking the prey. Here, we compared the attack strategies of three different species of avian predators (Japanese bush warblers [Horornis diphone], narcissus flycatchers [Ficedula narcissina], and Japanese tits [Parus minor]) which are found in the temperate forests of Japan. We found overall, that undefended prey was preferred over the defended prey, but the different predator species had different preferences and handled prey differently from one another. This suggests that different predator species might exert different selection pressures on chemically defended prey and this adds to our growing appreciation that predator behavior can vary among predator species. Moreover, our findings emphasize the importance of understanding differences in behavior among free-living predator species in studies of aposematism and mimicry.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10164-020-00668-w.pdf,link.springer.com,galbula,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-6.950909426448358,"['parus minor', 'ficedula narcissina', 'horornis diphone']",610

My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed).

Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks.

Due to the direct effect resource acquisition has on an individual’s fitness and species’ survival, predation risk is considered widely to be a major driver of foraging decision. The objectives of this study were to investigate how predation risk is perceived by granivorous bird species with respect to different habitat and microhabitat types, time of day and food types in Amurum Forest Reserve, Nigeria, with a view to direct future conservation planning. For 3 months, we conducted field experiments to measure giving-up densities (GUD, the amount of food left behind in artificial patches after birds cease to forage in it) and how it differs with habitat types, microhabitats, times of day, and food types. General linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) were fitted to investigate the differences in GUD with respect to the aforementioned variables. Model selection was done based on the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). There was no significant difference in GUDs across habitats. However, there was a significant difference in GUDs between microhabitats. Higher food remnants were recorded in the open than in cover microhabitats, as birds exploited food patches in the cover more. Time of day influenced foraging behavior in the birds. They foraged more in the morning than afternoon across all three habitats except for the gallery forest where birds foraged less in the morning. Higher GUDs were recorded in open than cover microhabitats both in the morning and the afternoon. Birds had a preference for rice, millet, and groundnut respectively. The differences in GUDs were very indicative of differences in foraging behavior and perception of resource availability in response to perceived predation risk. Therefore, this study suggests that the understanding of foraging decisions can be a veritable method for assessing habitat quality as perceived by animals.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0173-6,avianres.biomedcentral.com,firefinch,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.96331525262534,,959

Furthermore, the new and increasing number of models used to estimate moult duration systematically omit the fact that suspended moults can occur and that they significantly alter parameter estimates. Taking suspended moults into account is critical to obtain reliable moult-associated parameter estimates, which is fundamental given the demographic and evolutionary consequences of moult in birds. The main goal of this work is to develop a standardised method useful for characterising the main moulting parameters (such as the duration and starting date) of bird species that perform suspended moults. Additionally, with the aim of delving into our understanding of when and why suspended moults happen, we study their relationship with the occurrence of second breeding attempts in summer. We used data obtained from a Red Crossbill population in the Pyrenees during a period of 17 years. We observed that the percentage of crossbills undergoing suspended moult was approximately 50% during summer (July–August) and that moult suspension ultimately gives rise to a lengthened moulting period. Underhill–Zucchini models assume a time-linear replacement of feathers, overestimating the moult duration. Based on these same modelling approaches, we proposed a method to calculate the real moult duration after removing the time during which the moult was suspended. We also obtained evidence supporting the idea that crossbills suspend their moult as a strategy that could increase their breeding output in summer. The method proposed here can be used as a tool for working with species that undergo suspended moults.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01739-7.pdf,link.springer.com,citril,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.96736207150062,['red crossbill'],875

Its breeding range spans longitudinally across most of North America in the northern U.S. and southern Canada, and its population has declined by 59% from 1971 to 2014.

Using the Bayesian clustering approach, STRUCTURE, we found low levels of genetic differentiation across the breeding range. Fst values ranged from 0.002 to 0.036 among all population pairs, and genetic structure followed an isolation by distance model. Despite low levels of genetic differentiation, we found evidence for four genetic groupings—breeding populations in Oregon and British Columbia were distinct from each other as well as from Central and eastern North American breeding populations. Investigating the demographic history of the populations using approximate Bayesian computation, we found evidence that western Bobolink populations are not relict populations but instead were founded during a recent westward range expansion, possibly enabled by agricultural expansion.

In assessing genetic diversity in species that are of conservation concern, several studies have focused on the use of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are innate immune genes related to pathogen resistance, and polymorphisms may reflect not only levels of functional diversity, but may also be used to assess genetic diversity within and among populations. Here, we combined four potentially adaptive markers (TLRs) with one mitochondrial (COI) marker to evaluate genetic variation in the endangered Sierra Madre Sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi). This species offers an ideal model to investigate population and evolutionary genetic processes that may be occurring in a habitat restricted endangered species with disjunct populations (Mexico City and Durango), the census sizes of which differ by an order of magnitude. TLRs diversity in the Sierra Madre Sparrow was relatively high, which was not expected given its two small, geographically isolated populations. Genetic diversity was different (but not significantly so) between the two populations, with less diversity seen in the smaller Durango population. Population genetic structure between populations was due to isolation and different selective forces acting on different TLRs; population structure was also evident in COI. Reduction of genetic diversity in COI was observed over 20 years in the Durango population, a result likely caused by habitat loss, a factor which may be the main cause of diversity decline generally. Our results provide information related to the ways in which adaptive variation can be altered by demographic changes due to human-mediated habitat alterations.

As urban ecosystems are becoming more prevalent in the world and biotic homogenization is a concern, our aim here was to understand how environments near airports (hereafter “airport-affected” sites) were affected, to assess possible changes in bird community structure. We used mist-nets and sound automatic recording units to catalog bird species in natural sites influenced by three Brazilian airports and in three quiet control sites. We characterized study sites by their landscape structure, noise and light levels, and evaluated avian community structure using species richness, abundance and β diversity indexes. Avian communities presented slightly higher species richness in quiet control than in airport-affected sites. Of 22 widespread species, we identified 10 airport adapters responsible for 38.7% of total abundance in airport-affected sites and 17.2% in quiet control sites. We also identified 11 airport avoiders, presenting opposite trends (8.1% and 30.9% respectively). The β diversity results indicate that the regional pool is an important driver in defining species presence within the studied airports.

Past research has primarily focused on survival, making it unclear if temperature fluctuations constrain reproductive success, and if so whether populations harbour the potential to respond to climatic shifts. Here, using two decades of data from a large experimental breeding programme of the iconic ostrich (Struthio camelus) in South Africa, we show that the number of eggs females laid and the number of sperm males produced were highly sensitive to natural temperature extremes (ranging from −5 °C to 45 °C). This resulted in reductions in reproductive success of up to 44% with 5 °C deviations from their thermal optimum. In contrast, gamete quality was largely unaffected by temperature.&nbsp;Extreme temperatures also&nbsp;did not expose trade-offs between gametic traits. Instead, some females appeared to invest more in reproducing at high temperatures, which may facilitate responses to climate change. These results show that the robustness of fertility to temperature fluctuations, and not just temperature increases, is a critical aspect of species persistence in regions predicted to undergo the greatest change in climate volatility. Climate change may pose a challenge not only for survival of animals but also for their reproduction. Here, Schou et al. analyse how male and female ostrich fertility relates to fluctuating temperature across 20 years, finding reduced fertility away from the thermal optimum, but also individual variation in thermal tolerance.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-20937-7.pdf,nature.com,karoo,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-6.98829735374322,['struthio camelus'],442

The plumage of adult female common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) is either rufous (typically rare) or grey (common), whereas adult male conspecifics are monochromatic (grey). In previous studies, hosts and conspecific males responded with less intensity toward the rare female morph in support of a negative frequency-dependent benefit of female plumage polychromatism. Here, we assessed responses of both conspecific females and males to vocal playbacks of female calls, coupled with one of two 3D models of the different morphs of female cuckoos. At our study population, the rufous female morph was as common as the grey morph; therefore, we predicted similarly high rates of conspecific responses in both treatments. Both female and male cuckoos responded to playbacks acoustically, which demonstrated the primary role of acoustic communication in social interactions amongst cuckoos. Following this, some cuckoos flew closer to the models to inspect them visually. As predicted, no significant differences were detected between the live cuckoos’ responses toward the two colour morphs in this population.

A case study involving the market monitoring of the Sumatran Laughingthrush Garrulax bicolor,"A considerable variety of Indonesian avifauna is forced into the domestic and international pet trade, where the majority of individuals are caught in the wild. To monitor the volume and development of the trade and to evaluate the threat status of the traded species, bird market surveys are usually performed. The most commonly used monitoring technique is the “Direct Counting Method – DCM”, i.e. the counting of openly displayed individuals offered for sale. In this study, we evaluate the reliability of the outputs that DCM delivers by conducting regular long-term bird censuses at two of the main animal markets in Medan (Sumatra, Indonesia) involving 10 major local vendors specialising in the Sumatran Laughingthrush (Garrulax bicolor; SL), our target species. Both markets were visited from March to December 2015 with three different survey intervals (one, two and four visits per month). In total, according to DCM, we recorded up to 461 SL individuals offered for sale. However, a comparison of the monthly logs recorded directly by the vendors during the same period revealed that DCM only uncovered a negligible proportion of the total trade. Specifically, we detected only 4.6%, 8.1% and 16.1% of the traded SL individuals in relation to the set survey intervals. While the numbers of recorded SL individuals according to DCM and the three survey intervals were significantly interrelated, none of them correlated with the real numbers of traded birds provided by the vendors. Our results suggest that census-based market data are underestimated, and represent an unknown proportion of true trade volumes, regardless of the intensity of visits. In order to obtain reliable data and prevent the underestimation of the volume of trade, we recommend of undisclosed monitoring of markets and the engagement of trusted individuals with a past personal interest in this field or, if possible, the vendors themselves.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7429E97633FB6DF5BFB77A89F33E298C/S095927092000026Xa.pdf/div-class-title-what-is-the-reliability-of-visually-based-animal-trade-census-outcomes-a-case-study-involving-the-market-monitoring-of-the-sumatran-laughingthrush-span-class-italic-garrulax-bicolor-span-div.pdf,cambridge.org,caugek,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-6.99926903515897,"['sumatran laughingthrush', 'garrulax bicolor']",719

We sought to use current advancements in species distribution modeling to improve models of Everglades wading bird distribution. Using a joint species distribution model that accounted for imperfect detection, we modeled the presence of nine species of wading bird simultaneously in response to annual hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics within the Everglades system. Our resulting model improved upon the previous model in three key ways: 1) the model predicts probability of occupancy for the nine species on a scale of 0–1, making the output more intuitive and easily comparable for managers and decision-makers that must consider the responses of several species simultaneously; 2) through joint species modeling, we were able to consider rarer species within the modeling that otherwise are detected in too few numbers to fit as individual models; and 3) the model explicitly allows detection probability of species to be less than 1 which can reduce bias in the site occupancy estimates.

High crab density areas are associated with lower richness and densities of macroinvertebrates. Shorebird assemblages were also less rich at high crab density areas and the differences in species composition occurred according to prey type preferences. Fiddler crab density was the most important variable explaining macroinvertebrate abundance, after accounting for the effects of fine fraction of sediment and distance to coast. Nonetheless, a controlled experimental setup would be required to attribute differences found to the engineering activity of fiddler crabs rather than other unaccounted habitat features.

Morphological, behavioural, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) sequence data led a previous study to recognise the two extant populations as distinct conservation management units. Here, we further examine the genetic relationship between the extant populations using two nuclear introns (β-fibint7 and PAX). Using one mitochondrial locus (CO1), we also investigate the past distribution of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that differentiates the modern populations using bone and museum skins sourced from within its former range across New Zealand’s North and South Islands. We found significant population genetic structure between the two extant Cook’s Petrel populations for one of the two nuclear introns (β-fibint7). The mitochondrial DNA CO1 analysis indicated that the SNP variant found in the Codfish Island population was formerly widely distributed across both the North and South Islands, whereas the Little Barrier Island variant was detected only in North Island samples. We argue that these combined data support the recognition of the extant populations as different subspecies. Previous names for these taxa exist, thus Cook’s Petrel from Little Barrier Island becomes Pterodroma cookii cookii and Cook’s Petrel from Codfish Island becomes P. c. orientalis. Furthermore, we suggest that both genetic and non-genetic data should be taken into consideration when planning future mainland translocations. Namely, any translocations on the South Island should be sourced from Codfish Island and future translocations on the North Island should continue to be sourced from Little Barrier Island only.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/BB38D1BB99218BA3B2963283FECBA761/S0959270920000350a.pdf/div-class-title-comprehensive-evidence-for-subspecies-designations-in-cook-s-petrel-span-class-italic-pterodroma-cookii-span-with-implications-for-conservation-management-div.pdf,cambridge.org,pterodroma,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-7.018633581052304,['pterodroma cookii'],415

In this investigation, we quantified diel and seasonal variation in song output by studying a breeding population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis). We used autonomous recorders to collect extensive recordings across the breeding season in a long-term, colour-marked study population of Savannah Sparrows in eastern Canada. We described diel and seasonal variation across five different breeding stages based on recordings of more than 50,000 songs from 34 males. During the pre-breeding stage, prior to female arrival, males sang a pronounced dawn chorus with a peak in song output during the early morning. During the breeding stage, in contrast, the dawn chorus was diminished and males instead exhibited a pronounced dusk chorus with a peak in song output during the evening. Across the breeding season, the highest levels of song output occurred in late April and early May, soon after males arrived on the breeding grounds, and the lowest levels occurred in August, prior to the departure of birds for the wintering grounds. These patterns suggest that Savannah Sparrows’ early-season dawn choruses are directed at males and serve a territorial defense function. Later-season dusk choruses, in contrast, appear to play a role in attracting mates and possibly acoustic mate guarding.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0165-6,avianres.biomedcentral.com,chaffinch,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.02424918577702,['passerculus sandwichensis'],1024

For example, in Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany) over a third of the state’s critically endangered Woodlark (Lullula arborea) population breeds in vineyards along the western margin of the Upper Rhine Valley. We here aim to elucidate how local ground cover management, food availability and the proximity to settlements affect territory selection by this bird species in the region. As climate, site conditions and management differ greatly from more continental or Mediterranean wine-growing areas, conditions for Woodlark conservation may differ as well.We compared 26 Woodlark territories in vineyards with 26 nearby reference areas from which Woodlarks were absent. We recorded vineyard ground cover in the inter-rows (% cover) as well as vegetation height and composition (forbs vs. grasses). Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, since they are the main food resource of Woodlarks during the breeding season. In addition, the distance to built-up areas was measured. The vegetation in Woodlark territories was shorter (mean 14.2 vs. 19.6 cm) and more dominated by forbs (39% vs. 27% cover) than in absence areas. The vegetation cover in the inter-rows had no effect on Woodlark territory presence or absence. Woodlarks also favoured areas with a higher abundance of arthropods (mean abundance 69.1 vs. 57.5) and a greater distance to built-up areas (mean distance 554 vs. 373 m). We conclude that to promote the Woodlark in wine-growing areas, short, forb-rich swards should be created, facilitating arthropod detectability. This is likely to require low levels of nitrogen fertilization since fertilizers favour tall-growing grasses that outcompete forbs. Pesticide applications should be kept at a minimum to enhance arthropods as the main food source for Woodlarks and their chicks. In addition, the expansion of settlements into breeding areas of Woodlarks should be avoided.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01862-4.pdf,link.springer.com,woodlark,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.02821834726936,"['lullula arborea', 'woodlark']",430

Field trials testing a prototype toxic bait (HOGGONE 2 containing 5% sodium nitrite [SN]), though, revealed that wild pigs spilled small particles of toxic bait outside of bait stations which subsequently created hazards for non-target species that consumed those particles, primarily passerine birds. To deter non-target birds from consuming particles of spilled bait, we tested four deterrents at mock bait sites (i.e., baited with bird seed) in north-central Colorado, USA during April–May 2020. We found a programable, inflatable deterrent device (scare dancer) reduced bird visitation by an average of 96%. Then, we evaluated the deterrent devices at SN-toxic bait sites in north-central Texas, USA during July 2020, where the devices were activated the morning following deployment of SN-toxic bait. Overall, we found 139 dead wild pigs at 10 bait sites following one night of toxic baiting, which represented an average of 91% reduction in wild pigs visiting bait sites. We found that deterrent devices were 100% effective at deterring birds from toxic bait sites. We found two dead non-target mice at bait sites without deterrent devices. We noted that deploying toxic bait in mid-summer rather than late-winter/early-spring reduced hazards to migrating birds because they were not present in our study area during July. We recommend using deterrent devices (i.e., novel, programmable, battery operated, continuous and erratic movement, and snapping sounds) to reduce hazards to non-target birds at SN-toxic bait sites.

'A creature of such bizarre and extravagant appearance it seems less a living being than the product of some feverish Oriental fantasy. One of the world 's great natural treasures and at the same time one of nature's supreme oddities, it is that species of bird to which ornithologists have given the name Buceros bicornis: the Great Hornbill' - Richard Ives. Pilai Poonswad began studying hornbills in Thailand after she became fascinated by them while acting as a guide to a BBC film crew in Khao Yai National Park when working on a documentary film entitled Fig Feast in Khao Yai. With Atsuo Tsuji she started to document the life of these birds and together they have spent more than 20 years studying this unique family. At first very little was known about hornbills and Pilai began her research by observing a Great Hornbill feeding in a fig tree and then, with the help of an assistant, tracing it back to its nest site. Now, hundreds of hornbill nests have been recorded and research sites have been set up to study the life history of these wonderful birds. Pilai's work has culminated with the organisation of the First International Asian Hornbill Workshop in 1992 and the Second International Asian Hornbill Workshop in 1996. Both were held in Thailand. The proceedings of the first workshop were published (1) in a Manual to the Conservation of Asian Hornbills and the proceedings of the Second Workshop, The Asian Hornbills: Ecology and Conservation, are in preparation and will be available soon. Of the 31 Asian hornbill species (out of a world total of 54 species), 13 have been recorded in Thailand (2). In Asia, hornbills mainly live in monsoon evergreen forests or rainforests and their distribution and 1997 estimated population sizes in Thailand are indicated in Maps 1–4 (maps not in web version). Hornbills nest in cavities in living trees such as Dipterocarpus sp. and Syzygium sp. They are unable to excavate their own nest holes and they must find available cavities, indeed, the availability of nesting cavities of an appropriate size is one of the population limiting factors. In Thailand hornbills begin searching for nest sites at the end of the monsoon season, in December or January. The male will locate a possible nest cavity and invite the female to inspect. Once she is satisfied with the choice of nest site, copulation occurs nearby. The female then seals herself inside the nest chamber using clay, rotten wood, regurgitated food and other materials supplied by the male. It usually takes three to seven days to complete this sealing process. The female lays her eggs, incubates them and then rears the chick inside the nesting cavity, the entire nesting process taking from three to four months. During this time the male feeds the female and later on supports the chicks as well. (Tickell's and Austen's) Brown, Bushy-crested and White-crowned Hornbills employ a co-operative breeding strategy. This means they have nest helpers, usually yearlings of the same family, to assist with the feeding of the female and the chicks.

Digital photographs of wings offer an alternative method of capturing this data from hunting bags, but the accuracy and suitability of this method have not previously been adequately assessed. To investigate the accuracy of species, age and sex determinations from digital photographs of wings, we sent 97 photographs of wings which had been determined in hand to experienced duck ringers.

Our results support the use of digital photographs for the determination of species and sex for these species. However, further work is required to identify the factors which could increase the successful determination of characteristics, especially age, from photos alone.

Ingestion of grit by birds has been documented primarily in species that feed on seeds and invertebrates. Although feeding mainly on nectar and small arthropods, hummingbirds also ingest grit, but why they do so is unclear. We quantified the number of grit particles in the stomachs of six species of hummingbirds during an annual cycle in a seasonal ecosystem of West Mexico. We compared the number of grit particles in the stomachs of different hummingbird species (Mexican Violetear Colibri thalassinus, Amethyst-throated Mountaingem Lampornis amethystinus, White-eared Hummingbird Basilinna leucotis, Rivoli’s Hummingbird Eugenes fulgens, Broad-tailed Hummingbird Selasphorus platycercus, and Rufous Hummingbird S. rufus), and between sex and age categories during the different seasons of a year. To determine if grit was used to grind ingested arthropods, we examined the relationships between the number of grit particles, the biomass of arthropods ingested, and their chitin content. Although species did not differ in the number of grit particles in their stomachs, we found that grit was mostly ingested by female individuals, with only one male of one species (Mexican Violetear) presenting grit in its stomach. We also found that female hummingbirds had grit in their stomachs during the rainy and the cold-dry season (June–February) but not during the warm-dry season (March–May). Our analyses revealed no relationship between the number of grit particles and the amount of ingested arthropods and arthropod chitin content. However, high grit consumption was related to wasp ingestion on Mexican Violetears. Our results indicate that grit is used mainly by female hummingbirds. The seasonal variation in the ingestion of grit by female individuals suggests that it can be used to meet mineral requirements related to breeding; however, this topic needs further exploration.

Ground-foraging bird species were more parasitized than other birds, and species that inhabited open habitat were more frequently infested and were more likely to transmit B. burgdorferi to larval ticks feeding upon them.

Moreover, ecological characteristics of locations where these species occur were extracted from satellite imagery. Analysis of variance and linear regression models were used to examine relationships between food species abundances and predictor variables. Subsequently, maps for the food species were created using boosted regression trees (BRTs).

In the current study, we tested for divergence in functional morphological traits that are related to feeding ecology (i.e., bill morphology, body mass and condition) and/or to the locomotory performance in escaping from predators (i.e., wing, tarsus and tail morphology, body mass and condition) along a chronological gradient of urbanisation (old urban, recent urban and rural areas), using the New Zealand fantail, an endemic insectivorous passerine species. We found divergences in phenotypic traits related to bill morphology along the urban–rural gradient: birds inhabiting the old urban area had stubbier bills (i.e., shorter, deeper and wider bills) than those inhabiting the recent urban and rural areas. We did not detect any difference in locomotion-related morphological traits. Our results suggest the urbanisation-induced alteration in food resources may drive morphological divergence in bird populations. We emphasized the need for mechanistic and experimental studies, with a particular focus on resource-based mechanisms, to identify more precisely the morphological responses of urban populations to changes in food composition, and the resulting implications for communities in urban ecosystems.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11252-021-01156-w.pdf,link.springer.com,rhipidura,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-7.060942422241788,['new zealand fantail'],210

The birds follow several migration routes and share a number of wintering grounds. Although the Demoiselle Crane is distributed in many countries and has a long history of study, no efforts of assessing the population genetic structure of the species have been undertaken to date. We present the first results of the estimation of genetic diversity by sequencing the Control Region of mitochondrial DNA (1003 bp) and analyze spatial distribution of haplotypes on the northern edge of the species’ breeding range and genetic differentiation among territorial groupings. We studied 83 birds from six breeding groups in Europe (Azov-Black Sea, Caspian, Volga-Ural) and Asia (Trans-Ural, South Siberian, Transbaikal). Our research has revealed a high level of genetic diversity in all parts of the species’ range (Hd = 0.964) and showed the total genetic subdivision to be moderate (Wright’s FST = 0.075) with more differentiated European (FST = 0.128) and more homogenous Asian breeding groups (FST = 0.012). Genetic isolation of the territorial groupings seems to be incomplete suggesting substantial gene flow across the Demoiselle Crane breeding range that likely represents a formerly continuous breeding population fragmented just recently in Europe and only on its northern edge in Asia. At the same time, mitochondrial haplotype distribution and segregation of haplogroups specific to Europe and Asia may serve as evidence of an increasing genetic differentiation and reflect initial steps of the Demoiselle Crane gene pool structuring process.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01919-4.pdf,link.springer.com,demoiselle,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.06144709865565,['demoiselle crane'],257

However, these simplified systems dominate in many regions of the world, and a lack of understanding of what shapes species occurrence in these systems can have consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services at a massive scale. In Fennoscandia, ~90% of the boreal forest (~21Mha) is structurally simplified with little knowledge of how forest structural elements shape the occurrence and diversity of for example epiphytic lichens in these managed forests. One form of structural simplification is the reduction of the number and frequency of different tree species. As many lichen species have host tree preferences, it is particularly likely that this simplification has a huge effect on the lichen community in managed forests. In a 40–70 years old boreal forest in Sweden, we therefore related the occurrence and richness of all observed epiphytic lichens to the host tree species and beta and gamma lichen diversity at the forest stand level to the stand’s tree species composition and stem diameter. Picea abies hosted the highest lichen richness followed by Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Alnus glutinosa, Betula spp., and Populus tremula. However, P. tremula hosted twice as many uncommon species as any of the other tree species. Stand level beta and gamma diversity was twice as high on stands with four compared to one tree species, and was highest when either coniferous or deciduous trees made up 40–50% of the trees. The stem diameter was positively related to lichen richness at the tree and stand level, but negatively to beta diversity.

growth. We assessed these plans using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data. We
identified numerous environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with these projects,
including the dissection of 54 critical biodiversity habitats and diminished forest connectivity
across large expanses of the island. Key habitats of globally endangered species including
Goodfellow’s tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi), Matchie’s tree kangaroo (D.
matschiei), and several birds of paradise would also be bisected by roads and opened up to
logging, hunting, and habitat conversion. Many planned roads would traverse rainforests
and carbon-rich peatlands, contradicting Papua New Guinea’s international commitments to
promote low-carbon development and forest conservation for climate-change mitigation.
Planned roads would also create new deforestation hotspots via rapid expansion of logging,
mining, and oil-palm plantations. Our study suggests that several planned road segments in
steep and high-rainfall terrain would be extremely expensive in terms of construction and
maintenance costs. This would create unanticipated economic challenges and public debt.
The net environmental, social, and economic risks of several planned projects—such as the
Epo-Kikori link, Madang-Baiyer link, Wau-Malalaua link, and some other planned projects in

A total of 14 individuals were tracked with the aid of GPS (Geographical positioning system) satellite transmitters, and their sexes were identified using DNA analysis. A species utilization distribution was estimated using the Brownian bridge movement model (hereafter dBBMM) in which the probability of being in an area is conditioned by starting and ending (GPS) relocations. Resource selections were analysed by comparing the GPS relocations with locations randomly placed within each individual’s region of utilization in a spatio-temporal approach. Vegetation information was derived from a Serengeti GIS vegetation map and Data Centre and was reclassified as Open grassland, Dense grassland, Shrubbed grassland, Treed grassland, Shrubland, and Woodland. The Shannon diversity index for vegetation was calculated based on the original vegetation classification. Used versus non-used habitats were contrasted using a generalized linear mixed-effects model with a binomial distribution. The results indicated that males were 21.5% more mobile than females, and movements were 6.3% more diffuse during the non-breeding period compared to the breeding period (7.59 versus 7.14, respectively). Contrasting models indicated that males preferred more open grasslands during the non-breeding period and also preferred closed and shrubbed grassland during the breeding period. Females preferred more woody vegetation during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. The most parsimonious model indicated that females preferred to stay closer to rivers and diverse areas during the non-breeding period whereas males preferred areas that were farther from rivers and homogenous. Homogeneous areas were preferred during the breeding period, and heterogeneous areas were preferred during the non-breeding period.

Introduction The four species of Asian pitta that share buff underparts and conspicuous blue wing patches - Indian Pitta, Pitta brachyura, Fairy Pitta, P. nympha, Blue-winged Pitta, P. moluccensis, and Mangrove Pitta, P. megarhyncha - are clearly closely related species. Historically they have received various different taxonomic treatments, but there is now almost universal recognition of four species, all apparently monotypic. Sibley and Monroe placed the four species in a 'brachyura' superspecies group. Although there can now be little doubt that there are indeed four species, the taxonomic relationships between them remain unclear. Differences between the species suggest that they should in fact be divided into two superspecies groups, with Indian and Fairy in one and Blue-winged and Mangrove in the other. Three of the species overlap in range in South-East Asia, where, at certain times of the year, migratory Blue-winged Pitta can be found in the same areas as resident Mangrove or migratory Fairy Pittas. Indian Pitta is also migratory but has yet to be recorded in South-East Asia, although it is possible that it could occur as a vagrant. In the following account, a brief overview of the distribution, habitat, plumage and voice differences between the four species is given as an aid to identification in the field. Distribution and habitat Initial identification of these four species can be narrowed down easily through a knowledge of distribution and usual habitat requirements. Indian Pitta. Confined to the Indian subcontinent, where it is known as a breeding species in the foothills of the Himalayas, and a winter visitor in southern India and Sri Lanka. Apart from Mangrove Pitta, which has been found in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh, no other confusion species is present in the Indian subcontinent. Fairy Pitta. Known to breed in southern Japan; on Koje Island and the southern slopes of Mt Halla, Cheju Island, both off southern Korea, and perhaps on the South Korean mainland; on Taiwan; and in eastern China south to Kwangsi and Kwangtung.

Although the majority of birders visiting Sri Lanka concentrate on searching for the endemic species, they overlook the fact that the west coast provides an opportunity for observing some truly exciting seabirds From an ornithological point of view Sri Lanka can be considered to be an oceanic island - it is bounded on all sides by the Indian Ocean. (1) Nearly fifty seabird species have been recorded on the west coast of Sri Lanka, (2) of these five are known to breed and three are suspected to do so. (3) The remaining species include several winter visitors, a few passage migrants, a summer breeding visitor and a number of vagrants, stragglers, and species whose status is currently uncertain. While the entire coast of the island is suitable for watching seabirds, most of the northern and eastern areas cannot currently be visited on account of a military conflict, hence, this article confines itself to the subject of seawatching on the western and south-western coast. The best season for seawatching is during the south west monsoon (usually May - October). Several species enter coastal waters at this time, among these are the Wedge-tailed Shearwater, Puffinus pacificus, Wilson's Storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus, Lesser Frigatebird, Fregata ariel, Brown Skua, Catharacta antarctica, Pomarine Skua, Stercorarius pomarinus, Brown Noddy, Anous stolidus, Lesser Noddy, Anous tenuirostris. A mass-migration of Bridled Terns, Sterna anaethetus, takes place during the south-west monsoon. This migration, which usually begins around June/July and continues until October/November, is often a spectacular phenomenon. Bridled Tern © Tony Palliser In favourable years as many as 400,000 birds fly southwards during daytime - well within sight of land. (4) The most intensive movement occurs for a week or two in (either) August or September when, in the early mornings, 2,000 to 3,000 birds may fly south in a single hour, well within view of an observer on the beach. (5) The migrating Bridled Terns are at times accompanied by small numbers of Sooty Terns, Sterna fuscata, skuas, boobies and shearwaters. Both the Pomarine and Brown Skuas kleptoparasitise the migrating terns by stealing their catches whenever opportunities arise. At present the area (or areas) of origin of the migrants is not known, nor is their ultimate destination. It is suspected that the migration is a post-breeding dispersal of birds nesting in possibly the Red and Arabian seas, Makran coast of Pakistan and the Maldives.

The Yellow Sea region holds the primary stopover sites for many shorebirds during their migration to and from northern breeding grounds. However, the functional roles of these sites in shorebirds’ stopover ecology remain poorly understood. Through field surveys between July and November 2015, we investigated the stopover and moult schedules of migratory shorebirds along the southern Jiangsu coast, eastern China during their southbound migration, with a focus on the ‘Critically Endangered’ Spoon-billed Sandpiper Calidris pygmaea and ‘Endangered’ Nordmann’s Greenshank Tringa guttifer. Long-term count data indicate that both species regularly occur in globally important number in southern Jiangsu coast, constituting 16.67–49.34% and 64.0–80.67% of their global population estimates respectively, and it is highly likely that most adults undergo their primary moult during this southbound migration stopover. Our results show that Spoon-billed Sandpiper and Nordmann’s Greenshank staged for an extended period of time (66 and 84 days, respectively) to complete their primary moult. On average, Spoon-billed Sandpipers and Nordmann’s Greenshanks started moulting primary feathers on 8 August ± 4.52 and 27 July ± 1.56 days respectively, and their moult durations were 72.58 ± 9.08 and 65.09 ± 2.40 days.

Low rates of philopatry are linked to populations with high dispersal, while high rates are linked to populations with a very high spatial structure pattern (i.e., metapopulations). The Cantabrian Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) population is considered to be resident, with relatively low dispersal rates. Precise estimations of its philopatry rates are however still lacking. Here, we aimed to estimate philopatry rates in the main Yellow-legged Gull colonies of the province of Gipuzkoa, in the southeastern part of the Bay of Biscay. We analysed 734 resightings, during the breeding season at the colonies of Getaria, Santa Clara and Ulia, relative to a total of 3245 individuals ringed at birth in these same colonies during a period of 13 years. These data were analysed using Multi-State Recapture models in MARK. After controlling survival and resighting probability, the average dispersal rate among colonies was 4% (± SD = 2%) when individuals are immature, decreasing to 1 ± 1%) for adult breeding gulls (i.e., philopatry rate was 99%). Annual survival rates were assessed to be 0.27 ± 0.02 for birds in their first year of life and 0.87 ± 0.01 for older individuals. The probability of observing immature birds in the colonies was 0.08 ± 0.01, as compared to 0.21 ± 0.02 in adult birds.

Many of the impacts that this behavior can have on other species also sharing these spaces are obvious. A prime example is the devastating current extinction crisis. Yet some populations of non-human, non-domesticated species survive or even appear to thrive in heavily disturbed or human-built habitats. Theoretically, this apparent paradox could be facilitated partly by the evolution of genetically-mediated trait adaptations to the impacts of human behavior. At the least, persistence in strongly modified habitats would provide requisite selection pressures for this process to potentially occur in the future. In fact, we have a growing number of well-characterized examples of morphological trait adaptations to human behavior. However, our knowledge of genetically-mediated behavioral adaptations in similar contexts is less well developed. In this review I set up and discuss several evolutionary scenarios by which human behavior might have impacted the evolution of genetically mediated behavior in non-human, non-domestic species and highlight several approaches that could be used in future studies of this process.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00359-020-01415-9.pdf,link.springer.com,bosse,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.06691040051712,,758

Migrating herbivores, for example, are hypothesized to track seasonal foliage dynamics over large spatial scales. Previous investigations of this green wave hypothesis involved few species and limited geographical extent, and used conventional correlation that cannot disentangle alternative correlated effects. Here, we introduce stochastic simulations to test this hypothesis using 222 individual spring migration episodes of 14 populations of ten species of geese, swans and dabbling ducks throughout Europe, East Asia, and North America. We find that the green wave cannot be considered a ubiquitous driver of herbivorous waterfowl spring migration, as it explains observed migration patterns of only&nbsp;a few grazing populations in specific regions. We suggest that ecological barriers and particularly human disturbance likely constrain the capacity of herbivorous waterfowl to track the green wave in some regions, highlighting key challenges in conserving migratory birds. The green wave hypothesis is often considered a key driver of spring migration in avian herbivores. Here the authors employ a multispecies comparison and find that migration did not track the green wave better than simulated stochastic migrations.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09971-8.pdf,nature.com,screamer,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.06839404222101,,1070

The first was a culvert widening to increase tidal flushing in an attempt to stop the spread of the invasive plant, Phragmites australis. The second, four years later, was a complete inundation of the surrounding salt marsh due to the closure of a tidal inlet. The effect of these events on salt marsh vegetation was monitored using transects and on the marsh avian community using point counts. The inundation event, although limited to one growing season, had a more pronounced negative effect on marsh organisms than the restoration. Saltmarsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, took approximately three years to recover to pre-inundation abundance. Salt marsh hay, Spartina patens, had still not recovered five years after the inundation. This supports the idea that this high marsh plant is particularly sensitive to prolonged inundation. There was no measurable effect of either the hydrological restoration or the inundation event on P. australis. Saltmarsh sparrows declined 79% in the years immediately following the inundation, then recovered to their pre-inundation level in about eight years. Seaside sparrows declined 49% immediately following the inundation event and recovered after eight years, although there was a great deal of variation.

Nonetheless, a small isolated population of the Humboldt subspecies of Pacific martens (Martes caurina humboldtensis) occupies a narrow strip of young, coastal forest (< 70 years old) but not inland mature forest in the central Oregon Coast Range. We examined factors contributing to this unexpected distribution of martens by 1) analyzing marten diets using DNA metabarcoding to assess 90 scats, 2) using camera traps to assess differences in the relative abundances of prey, competitors, and predators across a coastal to inland gradient of vegetation types, and 3) quantifying differences in extent of fruit-producing shrubs and vegetation structure within vegetation types. Diets of martens were diverse (12, 10, and 3 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians respectively), and most fall and winter scats contained fruit. Voles, mice, and varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) were dominant prey items. Voles, mice, and most birds, but not varied thrushes, were more commonly observed in the coastal shrub-dominated forest than in inland forest. The coastal shrub-dominated forest had the highest diversity of vertebrates and potential prey overall. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), a key potential predator, were more commonly detected in inland forest. Of potential competitors, western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) were more commonly detected in inland forest, with gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) detected almost exclusively in coastal forests. Vegetation in coastal forests appears to provide, at least seasonally, more prey and fruit, and more overhead shrub cover compared with inland forest. Remaining plausible hypotheses for the restricted distribution of marten to coastal forests include increased prey, fruit, and overhead cover, and reduced predation risk from bobcats.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214653&type=printable,journals.plos.org,humblot,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.07327357372961,['ixoreus naevius'],1085

Here we describe the plumages and vocalisations of this population and discuss its taxonomic status. The analysis of plumage is based on field studies and photos available online. Recordings of vocalisations are compared with recordings from other Yellow Wagtail populations, and differences are analysed based on sonograms. Mitochondrial DNA from one individual is compared to other Yellow Wagtail taxa. Unlike M. flava subspecies breeding in or near Xinjiang, males in the studied population show a blue-grey head without prominent white supercilium, being most similar to the widely disjunct M. f. cinereocapilla. They differ from the similarly widely allopatric M. f. thunbergi, which might occur as a migrant or vagrant in Xinjiang, by on average cleaner yellow breast and more extensive white on the throat, and from the widely disjunct M. f. plexa and M. f. macronyx, which might also occur on migration in that area, by softer contact calls and slower pace of song. Females are similar to female M. f. feldegg in plumage. The mitochondrial ND2 tree shows the single sample from Xinjiang to be nested in the clade of western Yellow Wagtail taxa. We discuss whether the Xinjiang breeding population could represent an intergrade between subspecies breeding nearby, or whether it is better regarded as a separate as yet unrecognized subspecies. We argue that the localization of its apparent range in relation to other subspecies along with fairly consistent male and female plumages suggest that it is more likely to represent an undescribed taxon, but conclude that more research is needed to firmly establish its status.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00289-y,avianres.biomedcentral.com,wagtail,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.07422622716717,"['yellow wagtail', 'motacilla flava', 'western yellow wagtail']",179

Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare interannual dissimilarities in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition of bird communities along urban-rural gradients of three cities in central Argentina. Bird surveys were made in urban, suburban and rural habitats during December 2011 and December 2017. Dissimilarity indices were compared against null models. These models took into account differences in species richness between years. Differences in sample completeness between sampling units were taken into account. The interannual taxonomic dissimilarity was lower in urban habitats than in suburban and rural habitats. The abundance and frequency of the Rock Dove (Columba livia) and the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) in urban areas was stable between years, whereas the abundance and frequency of the Grassland Yellow-finch (Sicalis luteola) changed between years in rural areas. The interannual functional dissimilarity was lower in urban habitats than in rural habitats. Bird body mass and the abundance of granivorous species were stable in urban habitats, whereas most of the traits in rural areas changed their abundances between years. The interannual phylogenetic dissimilarity was comparable between habitats. Urban areas had a higher long-term persistence of taxonomic composition and functional traits than rural areas, supporting the idea that urban areas induce a temporal homogenization of bird communities.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11252-021-01132-4.pdf,link.springer.com,renard,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.08387698491051,"['sicalis luteola', 'rock dove', 'passer domesticus', 'house sparrow', 'columba livia']",335

Objectives We investigate how land cover change has altered patterns of compositional, functional and phylogenetic diversity of avian communities in a typical African savanna. We investigate if there has been selection for closely-related or functionally similar species with increasing land use intensity and how this has affected alpha and beta components of diversity. Methods We conducted point counts over 2 years in four distinct land cover types (urban, rural, protected and a transitional matrix), representing a gradient of land cover change. We compared alpha and beta phylogenetic, compositional and functional diversity between sites to assess whether land cover change has homogenized avian communities. Results While alpha diversity tended to be higher in transformed land cover types (urban, rural and matrix), measures of beta diversity among sites within these types were significantly lower than beta diversity within the protected area. Furthermore, assemblages in transformed areas were functionally and phylogenetically more similar than expectation based on a null model, particularly in the urban area.

Population genetics and genomics may help with the appropriate management of these species by (1) determining the population genetic structure of a species across its range, and (2) allowing the assignment of individuals to their breeding source.

This species ranges widely across ocean basins during the non-breeding season and is exposed to a variety of threats throughout the annual cycle. The impact of mortality during the nonbreeding season on individual breeding colonies is unknown but has important ramifications for conservation and management. In this study we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to provide 6614 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to investigate population genetic structure of northern fulmars using 127 individuals from six breeding colonies spanning the Atlantic.

The Chinese Grouse (Tetrastes sewerzowi) lives in high mountain conifer forests and faces energy stress, cold environment, and predation pressure. Females might adjust incubation rhythm to adapt to these constraints. Two methods were used to investigate egg laying and incubation pattern of the Chinese Grouse; 25 nests were monitored by data loggers and 12 nests by infrared video cameras.
 Female Chinese Grouses usually laid an egg every 2 days. The incubation period was 28–31 days. Overall incubation constancy for Chinese Grouse was 93%. The females took 5.0 recesses per day and 34% of all 1696 recesses were taken in the crepuscular period. The average recess duration was 20.3 min. Females took more and shorter recesses in the latter part of incubation. The females who allocated more time to foraging had a higher reproductive success.
 Probably due to its high egg/body mass ratio, the Chinese Grouse has a long laying interval of 49 h. We suggest that, due to energy stress, females have relatively more recesses and they increase the number of recesses as incubation progresses. To compensate for the embryos’ thermal needs, they extend the incubation period and shorten the recess duration in this cold environment.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0161-x,avianres.biomedcentral.com,capercaillie,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.0911093233796,['chinese grouse'],1041

For example, in the brown songlark (Cinclorhamphus cruralis), male nestlings were shown to be on average 49% heavier than female nestlings, and received 42% more food than female nestlings (Magrath et al. 2007). However, this might also happen for other reason.",en,Nestling sex does not influence provisioning effort of parents or helpers in a cooperative bird with a male-biased helper contingent,"Abstract In cooperatively breeding species, the level of investment by both breeders and helpers may be influenced by the sex of offspring in broods that they attend, due to different fitness payoffs associated with investing in male versus female offspring. This might be expected if the sexes differ markedly in either the cost of their rearing, due to factors such as sexual size dimorphism, or the level of help that they may provide in later life that might benefit helpers in the future. Here we investigate how nestling sex influences the provisioning efforts provided by helpers and the subsequent growth and development of offspring in the cooperatively breeding noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). In this species, helpers are predominantly philopatric males, as females disperse to other colonies to find breeding positions. We therefore predicted that helpers might invest more in helpful male-biased broods rather than those with dispersive female offspring, particularly if larger males required more resources than female offspring to successfully fledge. Male miners grew faster, fledging at the same age as their female siblings but with a heavier body mass. Male offspring therefore possibly require more resources than female offspring to raise. However, despite possible differences in the fitness returns of investing in different sexes, we were unable to detect any significant influence of brood sex ratio on the provisioning rate of pair or their helper contingent. Noisy miner helpers provision the brood irrespective of offspring sex. This could be due to an inability to recognise nestling sex, or potential future costs that might be imposed by philopatric males that subsequently compete for resources and/or mating opportunities with the helpers that reared them. From a male helper perspective, these potential costs may ultimately nullify benefits that male offspring provide in future. Significance statement Male and female offspring might have different fitness benefits for helpers in the cooperatively breeding species. Given this, helpers in this breeding system might have sex-dependant preferences and direct their help towards the apparently more beneficial sex (i.e. the sex that is expected to stay at the same population and provide help in return). In this study, we showed that in the cooperatively breeding noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), although male offspring are expected to provide higher level of care with over 90% of helpers being male, this apparent difference in the fitness return did not result in higher provisioning rate in the male-biased broods compared to female-biased broods. We argue that (a) this could be due insufficient cues for recognition of nestling sex or (b) despite the higher level of help that male offspring are expected to provide into the future, the overall inclusive fitness benefits do not vary among the sexes.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03038-9.pdf,link.springer.com,songlark,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-7.0940221008111735,"['manorina melanocephala', 'noisy miner']",305

However, it remains scarce to integrate multidimensional diversity for unveiling how variations in land cover may influence the patterns and processes of biotic homogenization in the Anthropocene. In this study, we examined how spatial variation of land cover could alter taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional homogenization of bird communities simultaneously in a compound ecosystem of Zoige Marsh on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Acting as the largest alpine marsh and peatland in the world, Zoige Marsh has undergone great changes in the land cover pattern due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. We conducted transect surveys for bird communities over six years (2014‒2019) during breeding seasons in four main land cover types (meadow, woodland, village and marsh), representing the spatial variation of land covers in the study area. We compared multidimensional diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity) among land covers to assess the effects of spatial variation in land cover type on bird communities, particularly whether this variation has homogenized biotic communities. Bird communities during breeding seasons were different and complementary in the four land covers. Taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional similarities were significantly lower in meadow than in the other three types, i.e. woodland, village and marsh. However, when we controlled for the effects of taxonomic similarities, the pattern of phylogenetic similarities almost reversed, with the highest standardized effect size (SES) phylogenetic similarity in meadow; and we found no significant difference in SES functional similarity among land covers. Our results suggest that spatial variation of land cover can play a crucial role in regulating multiple dimensions of bird diversity in Zoige Marsh. The findings indicate that taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional homogenization of bird communities may differently response to the variation of land covers. It thus highlights not only the relative roles of different land covers in maintaining biodiversity and community structures of birds, but also the urgency of retarding ecosystem degradations on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00259-4,avianres.biomedcentral.com,chine,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.09962307686337,,333

Additionally, we use spectrally-altered river noise to explicitly test the effects of masking as a mechanism driving patterns. Using data from abundance and activity surveys across 60 locations, over two full breeding seasons, we find that both birds and bats avoid areas with high sound levels, while birds avoid frequencies that overlap with birdsong, and bats avoid higher frequencies more generally. We place 720 clay caterpillars in willows, and find that intense sound levels decrease foraging behavior in birds. For bats, we deploy foraging tests across 144 nights, consisting of robotic insect-wing mimics, and speakers broadcasting bat prey sounds, and find that bats appear to switch hunting strategies from passive listening to aerial hawking as sound levels increase. Natural acoustic environments are an underappreciated niche axis, a conclusion that serves to escalate the urgency of mitigating human-created noise.

Avian brood parasites thus provide a unique opportunity to explore the effect of a lack of parental care in higher vertebrates because they shift care for their progeny onto other species. We investigated the social system of an avian brood parasite, the lesser cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus), by using a comprehensive approach that included field observation, radio-tracking, and genetic analyses. We found that genetically unrelated, multiple males and females coexist in a single area; radio-tracking confirmed that this co-occurrence was neither temporary nor arbitrary. Instead, sympatric cuckoos appeared to share their home ranges and often chased each other for mating without antagonistic physical interaction. We conclude that the lesser cuckoo may employ a scramble competition mating system without territoriality, and that this mating system, which is unusual in higher vertebrates, may have arisen due to the absence of parental care.

Further, we recorded nine Black-browed Albatrosses and two Great Shearwaters potentially dead. Although in the study fishery the number of deaths in the trawl cables could surpass the number of birds incidentally killed in nets, the mortality rate caused by the latter type of interaction far exceeds those observed in nets from other trawl fisheries operating in the Patagonian Shelf. Fortunately, 26% of the seabirds entangled in the net were recovered and released alive, which indicates that awareness and training in safe bird handling and release may improve captured seabird survival rates. The main objectives of this work is to highlight a little-studied source of seabird mortality by entanglement, to generate discussion on potential technical mitigation measures for side-haul trawl fisheries, and to propose crew training in safe handling and release of seabirds as an immediate mitigation measure.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/12EA314C52343D1F0577DA6567E38422/S0959270920000623a.pdf/div-class-title-incidental-capture-of-seabirds-in-argentinean-side-haul-trawlers-div.pdf,cambridge.org,ardenna,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.114681906521083,"['ardenna gravis', 'diomedea epomophora', 'thalassarche melanophris', 'procellaria aequinoctialis', 'southern royal albatross']",140

Northern Mozambique’s ‘sky-island’ mountains have become increasingly recognised for their Afromontane birdlife. Despite growing ornithological coverage, however, several Mozambican mountains remain poorly known. We present results from a three-week survey of three such mountains: the Njesi Plateau, Mount Chitagal and Mount Sanga (collectively termed the Serra Jeci/Njesi highlands) in Niassa, north-western Mozambique. These mountains had received little/no previous biological surveys, but are the only known locality of the endangered Mozambique Forest-warblerArtisornis sousae(formerly Long-billed TailorbirdA. moreaui sousae). We recorded 159 species, including several range-extensions of both conservation and biogeographical importance (e.g. Dapple-throatArcanator orostruthus), and 15 Afromontane biome-restricted species, including two species new for Mozambique (Montane NightjarCaprimulgus poliocephalusand Dark BatisBatis crypta). We found good numbers of Mozambique Forest-warblers on all three mountains, extending the distribution of this little-known and highly range-restricted taxon. Combining our data with previous surveys (collectively totalling 184 species), we critically appraise the Njesi Important Bird Area (MZ015), based on the occurrence of 26 Important Bird Area (IBA) trigger species, correcting previous errors in its assessment and suggest extensions that include Mount Sanga to the north, and extensive miombo woodland to the west. The site also qualifies as a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) and Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) site. Finally, we review all published ornithological literature from Mozambique’s mountains and discuss emergent biogeographical patterns in their Afromontane avifauna, while also highlighting key sites that require ornithological surveys. We find that the Njesi highlands are more biogeographically linked to Tanzania, than to mountains farther south in Mozambique and Malawi. Collectively, our results illustrate the critical value of even small Afromontane forests on remote highlands for some of Africa’s least known, and most threatened avifauna.",,nisc.co.za,dapple-throat,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.11785962285323,,780

Seabirds provide a unique opportunity to understand patterns of niche segregation among coexisting species because they form large multi-species colonies of breeding aggregations with seemingly overlapping diets and foraging areas. Recent biologging tools have revealed that colonial seabirds can differentiate components of their foraging strategies. Specifically, small, diving birds with high wing-loading may have small foraging radii compared with larger or non-diving birds. In the Gulf of St-Lawrence in Canada, we investigated whether and how niche differentiation occurs in four incubating seabird species breeding sympatrically using GPS-tracking and direct field observations of prey items carried by adults to chicks: the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). Although there was overlap at foraging hotspots, all species differentiated in either diet (prey species, size and number) or foraging range. Whereas puffins and razorbills consumed multiple smaller prey items that were readily available closer to the colony, murres selected larger more diverse prey that were accessible due to their deeper diving capability. Kittiwakes compensated for their surface foraging by having a large foraging range, including foraging largely at a specific distant hotspot. These foraging habitat specialisations may alleviate high interspecific competition allowing for their coexistence, providing insight on multispecies colonial living.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81583-z.pdf,nature.com,bernier,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.12435589512909,"['common murre', 'fratercula arctica', 'uria aalge', 'atlantic puffin', 'rissa tridactyla', 'alca torda', 'kittiwake', 'razorbill']",447

It has been classified as Near Threatened (1) by BirdLife International based on its restricted range and the disappearance of its lowland forest habitat. The Bornean Bristlehead is a medium-sized (c. 25 cm) bird whose distinctive features are its massive hooked black bill and the short, yellowish to orange outgrowths of skin (3-4 mm long) on the crown which give the bird its English name. Other prominent features are its red face, throat, neck and thighs. The rest of the plumage is blackish, although in flight a white patch is visible in the wing. The sexes differ in that the female has red spots on the flanks, which are reduced or absent in the male. Juveniles have black rather than red thighs and red rather than grey ear coverts, and have fewer red feathers on the head and breast. In addition, the eye-ring is red and the head 'bristles' are undeveloped. The phylogenetic relationships of the species, supported by genetic evidence (2) place it as a close relative of the Australian Cracticids (magpies and butcherbirds) of the genera Cracticus, Gymnorhina and Strepera. Others(3) have placed the species within an enlarged Corvidae, with the Bristlehead in the tribe Artamini alongside Australian Butcherbirds (Cracticus), Australasian Magpie (Gymnorhina), Currawongs (Strepera), Woodswallows (Artamus), and Peltops (Peltops). Bornean Bristlehead, © Chris Artuso The species is widespread in Borneo from 0-600 m, but has also been reported at 1000-1200 m from Maliau, Sabah.(4) Witt & Sheldon (5) listed 62 sites from which the species had been recorded, to which the following can now be added; Lambir Hills National Park (Sarawak),(11) Lingga (Sarawak), Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary (Sarawak), Tawau Hills National Park (Sabah), Ulu Temburong (Brunei), and Sepipong Reserve (Brunei). It is described as common in the secondary and peat swamp forests of southern Brunei, and as particularly common in the Anduki Forest Reserve (Brunei).(5) Generally speaking though, the Bristlehead is an uncommon species, for example, in the Danum Valley, one of its strongholds, six days of dawn to dusk observation between 2-8 November 1998 resulted in the sighting of one group of six birds and another of two birds (JN). Observations in Similajau during 1986 and 1995 suggest that the species is patchily distributed in the park.(7) It is probable that groups range over a wide area but that during breeding these movements are more localised. Although considered a bird of primary forest, the Bristlehead is found in a range of wooded habitats including disturbed primary forest, upland kerangas, coniferous forest, Shorea albida peat swamp, and degraded coastal swamp forest (DM). Bristleheads were observed by Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zooology (WFVZ) near Gomantong caves (Sabah) in old logged forest that had been severely burned during the El Niño drought. They have also been observed in Acacia groves adjacent to primary forest at Sepilok (Sabah) (KI). At Selipong Reserve (Brunei Bay), flocks have been reported from a large area of unspoilt mangrove. They are frequently recorded in secondary or partially logged forest, in clearings, along forest edge and roadsides, possibly due to a higher abundance of invertebrates in these locations. Their occurrence in the Danum Valley, Sarawak, is unpredictable, suggesting that birds may wander large distances in search of food, and prolonged observations of a group of 3-6 birds at distance of 700-800 m has suggested this.(7) However, its appearance in the Danum Valley has been described as seasonal, indicating that some altitudinal movement may occur.",,orientalbirdclub.org,bristlehead,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.13868585037616,"['magpie', 'bornean bristlehead', 'pityriasis gymnocephala']",1000

Background: Field studies from 2011 onwards have demonstrated the presence of a breeding population of Yellow 
Wagtails (Motacilla flava) in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China that is phenotypically distinct from known 
subspecies occurring in Asia. Here we describe the plumages and vocalisations of this population and discuss its 
taxonomic status.
Methods: The analysis of plumage is based on field studies and photos available online. Recordings of vocalisations 
are compared with recordings from other Yellow Wagtail populations, and differences are analysed based on sono-
grams. Mitochondrial DNA from one individual is compared to other Yellow Wagtail taxa.
Results: Unlike M. flava subspecies breeding in or near Xinjiang, males in the studied population show a blue-grey 
head without prominent white supercilium, being most similar to the widely disjunct M. f. cinereocapilla. They differ 
from the similarly widely allopatric M. f. thunbergi, which might occur as a migrant or vagrant in Xinjiang, by on aver-
age cleaner yellow breast and more extensive white on the throat, and from the widely disjunct M. f. plexa and M. f. 
macronyx, which might also occur on migration in that area, by softer contact calls and slower pace of song. Females 
are similar to female M. f. feldegg in plumage. The mitochondrial ND2 tree shows the single sample from Xinjiang to be 
nested in the clade of western Yellow Wagtail taxa.
Conclusion: We discuss whether the Xinjiang breeding population could represent an intergrade between subspe-
cies breeding nearby, or whether it is better regarded as a separate as yet unrecognized subspecies. We argue that the 
localization of its apparent range in relation to other subspecies along with fairly consistent male and female plum-
ages suggest that it is more likely to represent an undescribed taxon, but conclude that more research is needed to 
firmly establish its status.

Their diel activity was restricted to the night, with higher calling rates after midnight. The breeding season of the Common Potoo, according to seasonal changes in vocal activity, seems to occur between July and November, while the breeding period of the Great Potoo extended from July to December. The reproduction periods proposed for each potoo in this study correspond mainly with the dry season in the study area and are in agreement with the few historical nest site observations from Brazil.

Therefore, how to maintain the biodiversity in urban ecosystem is crucial for sustainable urban planning and management, especially in arid and semiarid regions with relatively fragile environment and low biodiversity. Here, for the first time we linked species richness, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird assemblages in university campuses in northern China with plant species richness, glacial-interglacial climate change, contemporary climate, and anthropogenic factors to compare their relative roles in shaping urban bird diversity. Bird surveys were conducted in 20 university campuses across Inner Mongolia, China. Ordinary least squares models and simultaneous autoregressive models were used to assess the relationships between bird species richness, phylogenetic and functional structure with environmental factors. Structural equation models were used to capture the direct and indirect effects of these factors on the three components of bird diversity. Single-variable simultaneous autoregressive models showed that mean annual precipitation was consistently a significant driver for bird species richness, phylogenetic and functional structure. Meanwhile, mean annual temperature and plant species richness were also significant predictors for bird species richness. This study suggests that campuses with warmer and wetter climate as well as more woody plant species could harbor more bird species. In addition, wetter campuses tended to sustain over-dispersed phylogenetic and functional structure. Our findings emphasize the dominant effect of precipitation on bird diversity distribution in this arid and semiarid region, even in the urban ecosystem.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00212-x,avianres.biomedcentral.com,chine,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.15807974462417,,637

Consequently, we investigated three native frugivorous avian species’ role in potential dispersal and germination success of the invasive American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) in South Africa, particularly in terms of amount of fruit ingested, transit time, and their effects on seed germination. Three common species of frugivorous bird species were predicted to positively affect the spread of invasive R. cuneifolius. The bird species (speckled mousebirds Colius striatus, red-winged starlings Onychognathus morio and dark-capped bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor) were fed R. cuneifolius fruit in captivity and amounts ingested were determined together with transit times. Seeds that were excreted and/or regurgitated by the three bird species, manually extracted seeds, and control whole fruit were then planted and their germination assessed daily. Although the three bird species varied in the amount of fruit consumed (~ 10–30 g), there was no significant difference in amount of R. cuneifolius fruit eaten per gram body mass among the species. Bird-ingested seeds emerged a mean 21–23 days after planting, while the seeds from the whole fruit took longer to emerge (mean 28 days). Germination of seeds ingested by the respective bird species was significantly higher (~ 60–75%) than seeds manually removed from fruits (~ 52%) or seeds in whole fruits (~ 7%). This suggests that removal of pulp and seed coat abrasion by the birds increased germination success. The three bird species all had R. cuneifolius seed transit times greater than 20 min, demonstrating their potential to disperse seeds a distance away from the parent plant. The results showed that the three bird species increased the germination success and suggests they are potentially important dispersers of the invasive R. cuneifolius.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10530-019-02164-w.pdf,link.springer.com,mousebird,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.15971465882278,"['onychognathus morio', 'pycnonotus tricolor', 'colius striatus']",868

A team of ornithologists discovered, photographed, and obtained the first-ever footage of the rare babbler in its limestone habitat in Kotabaru Regency, South Kalimantan, Indonesia.

It is the first documentation of this species in its natural habitat following the picture of this bird on hand that circulated the internet after its rediscovery in 2020. This discovery has sparked global interest, given that the species has gone unobserved since colonial times. The Black-browed Babbler was initially described by the renowned French naturalist, Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, based on a single specimen collected by German geologist and naturalist Carl Anton Ludwig Maria Schwaner from his expeditions to southern Borneo around 1843-1848. This mysterious species, widely considered to be Borneo’s greatest ornithological enigma, was finally seen again in 2020 after being captured by a local resident. With a 172 years gap between its discovery and its first documentation in the wild, the species has indeed gone missing for a longer time than any other bird, including America’s presumed extinct Ivory-billed Woodpecker. While the researchers were able to glean several clues about the species’ ecology, much of its life history is still shrouded by mystery. It is currently listed as “Data Deficient” by IUCN, with no information regarding its population or range. It is also not listed as a protected species by the Indonesian government due to the lack of data, which may make it vulnerable to threats such as poaching or habitat destruction. In September 2021, a team of ornithologists from Birdpacker Indonesia collaborated with Kalimantan Selatan’s Natural Resource Conservation Agency (BKSDA Kalimantan Selatan) and Dinas Kehutanan Kalimantan Selatan KPH Cantung became the first team to explore the babbler’s habitat in an area of rugged limestone hills. The project was funded by Oriental Bird Club and American Bird Conservancy and was aimed to understand the status of the Black-browed Babbler’s population. On the first day of fieldwork, the team managed to re-find the bird and documented its natural behaviour for the first time in the wild. According to Panji Gusti Akbar, the lead scientist from Birdpacker Indonesia, a pair of the birds were spotted in thick undergrowth on the side of a karst cliff just a few hours after they commenced their search. The birds were very secretive and moved quietly in extremely rugged terrain, making them difficult to observe—which may help explain why their evaded science for so long. After an intense wait, one individual of this strikingly marked babbler finally perched close enough for the team to capture the very first images and footage of the species in the wild. “It was a breathtaking moment to finally see this species in the wild, as most of its natural history is entirely unknown—so that every single behaviour we observed can be new to science,” said Akbar.",,orientalbirdclub.org,babbler,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.16225445221244,,157

We used 12 microsatellite loci to genotype 582 individuals from eight localities across a large latitudinal range (30°S–56°S). Using population structure metrics, multivariate analyses, clustering algorithms, and Bayesian methods, we found evidence for moderately low regional genetic structure and reduced gene flow towards the range margins. Genetic differentiation increased with geographic distance, particularly in the southern part of the species’ distribution where forests are continuously distributed. Populations in the north seem to experience limited gene flow likely due to forest discontinuity, and may comprise a demographically independent unit. The southernmost population, on the other hand, is genetically depauperate and different from all other populations. Different analytical approaches support the presence of three to five genetic clusters.

J. Collar, chief editor of Threatened birds of Asia - the BirdLife International Red Data Book gives some background to the project. Since the early 1960s BirdLife International (formerly the International Council for Bird Preservation) has had the formal responsibility, conferred by IUCN-The World Conservation Union, for preparing and publishing the global Red Data Books which identify and document the world's threatened birds (these then feed into the IUCN Red List, which evaluates all species against numerical criteria for endangerment). In April 1981, when I took up the job of compiler of the bird RDB, ICBP's Executive Committee had decreed that the work should proceed geographically, beginning with Africa; and after Africa in 1985 it was decided to do the Americas, which took me through until 1992. This was, of course, deeply unfair to Asia. My most immediate but admittedly token attempt to compensate was to pick what seemed to be Asia's most threatened species and document it, in the hope that this might help matters. The result was the review paper on Gurney's Pitta Pitta gurneyi in Forktail 1: 29-51, written with Phil Round and David Wells, which helped confirm Phil in his long-held suspicion that the mysterious creature was a level-lowland forest dweller. In this sense it did intensify the focus and accelerate the search, resulting as we all now know in the great rediscovery-not a moment too soon-of May 1986, a few weeks before the paper itself appeared. (I continue to hold this up as evidence that Red Data Books really can make a contribution to species conservation; but sadly the international bird RDB programme is the only one that survives today.) The second and more considered attempt to compensate Asia (and indeed the rest of the undocumented species of the world) was to write, with Paul Andrew, a stop-gap annotated 'red list'. This book, Birds to watch, which appeared in early 1988, greatly expanded the number of birds formally listed as at risk in Asia, and gave the still very young Oriental Bird Club a clear focus in its conservation giving and in its reporting of records. Where the late 1970s RDB, compiled by Warren King, had treated a mere 52 Asian species as threatened (18 of them pheasants!), ten years on Birds to watch identified 286, five-and-a-half times as many. (One of the crucial immediate results of this was the establishment of the BirdLife Indonesia Programme, since Indonesia had suddenly leapt to the top of the table of countries with the most threatened birds, a position previously held by Brazil.) In 1994 Birds to watch 2 repeated the analysis, and in 2000 - with rather more detail and infinitely more pizzazz - Threatened birds of the world carried the species and categorisations that had been determined by the editors of the then almost complete Threatened birds of Asia. Nevertheless, the deep review of each Asian threatened species remained a gap that desperately needed filling. Detailed documentation greatly increases the confidence with which a team of compilers can determine whether a species is truly threatened or not. The nature of the problem can partly be gauged from this table of the changing status of threatened birds in Asia. The figures clearly suggest that the numbers of species in the region reckoned to be in danger have been stabilising over the past decade, and to a degree this is true, but internally there are still quite a number of adjustments taking place as species exit and enter the lists. Of the strigid owls, for example, 12 were listed in 1994 and nine in 2001, but only six of these are common to the two lists. Moreover, because the passerine totals for 1988 (113) and 2001 (114) are virtually identical, the species involved might also be assumed to be very similar; but in reality the lists are amazingly different, sharing between them as few as 70 species, which is a mere 45% of the 157 (70+43+44) present on both. It is not that the earlier analyses were substandard-rather it is that new descriptions, new taxonomic treatments, new circumstances and new information have combined down the years to create this retrospectively high degree of instability; but above all it has been the patient and exhaustive assembly and evaluation of all the information, from the literature, museum skins and personal witness, that has now, I believe, brought a new level of certainty to the current list.",,orientalbirdclub.org,skimmer,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.16775095311871,['pitta gurneyi'],1000

We used the theory of planned behaviour to measure socio-psychological determinants of behaviour and deepened this understanding using informant interviews and focus group discussions. Informants reported that so-called termite poisons, including powerful carbamates, are deliberately deposited at waterholes to catch wildlife for consumption. This method is perceived to be low effort and high efficacy, and perceptions of the health risks vary. Predominant users are young men and children, but it is unclear whether the practice is related to food insecurity. Threatened wildlife species reported as affected include the giant ibis Pseudibis gigantea and vulture species. Overall, social norms are strongly negative towards poisoning; 75% of survey respondents perceived negative norms because of impacts on human and livestock health, environmental quality, and risks of legal sanctions. This has led to interventions by local authorities in half of the studied villages. We suggest that future interventions should raise the salience of negative norms by providing a non-conflictual mechanism for community members to participate in monitoring and sanctioning, such as a reporting hotline.

The modern bird fauna of High Asia comprises a diversity of both ancient and recently diverged endemics, and thus is of general importance for historical biogeography and understanding the origin of modern high mountain ecosystems. However, the past history of the Central Asian highland avian communities remains practically unknown, as no fossil bird assemblages from high elevation areas were previously reported. In particular, it remains completely unexplored how birds responded to late Quaternary climatic fluctuations. Here we report the first fossil bird fauna from the High Asia and the first fossil birds from Tajikistan. An assemblage from the late Pleistocene through middle Holocene of Istykskaya cave (4060 m) in Eastern Pamir surprisingly comprises a remarkable diversity of waterbirds, including a few species that are completely absent from High Asia today and that were not reported globally from such high altitudes. The diversity of waterbirds incudes taxa of various ecological preferences (shorebirds, underwater and surface feeders, both zoophagous and phytophagous), strongly indicating the presence of a productive waterbody at the vicinity of the site in the past. These observations correspond to recent palaeoclimatic data, implying increased water availability in this region, currently occupied by high mountain semi-deserts.

An analysis across multiple temporal scales,"The Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) is a characteristic waterbird species of inland wetlands in northeastern Algeria. Its wintering behavior in relation to changes of local abundances and foraging group density is poorly known.
 This study aims at monitoring patterns of diurnal activities and the variation of behavioral time-budgets in relation to numbers of wintering Shelducks. We investigate temporal variations of diurnal activities across multiple-time scales and consider their interrelationships. Assessments of local population abundance were weekly surveyed during two wintering seasons (2010–2012), whereas diurnal activities (feeding, sleeping, swimming, preening, loafing, flying, courtship, and antagonism) were studied three times a month during seven hours (08:00–16:00) using the Scan method. Time budget variations of each behavioral activity were tested using nested ANOVAs following multiple time scales. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) tested whether variations in diurnal activities were density-dependent. During the wintering season, Shelduck’s numbers followed a bell-shaped trend, which indicated that the species was typically a wintering migrant in Sabkha Djendli. The first individuals arrived onsite in October–November then numbers reached a peak in January (up to 2400 individuals in 2012) with steady density during December–February, afterward individuals left the site progressively until late April when the site is deserted. During both wintering seasons, diurnal activities were dominated by feeding (60%), followed by sleeping (12%) then swimming and preening with 9% and 8%, respectively. The rest of the activities (loafing, flying, courtship and antagonistic behaviors) had low proportions of time budget. ANOVAs showed that activity time budgets varied significantly following multiple time scales (year, season, month, day, semi-hour). Time budgets of diurnal activities during each wintering season were significantly interrelated. Correlations patterns between the two seasons were similar. GLMMs revealed that the variations of diurnal activities were not density-dependent, except for preening and swimming. During the wintering season, habitats of Sabkha Djendli are important for waterbirds, including the Shelduck that used the lake mainly for food-foraging and resting. The 2400 individuals censused in mid-winter are important locally and at the North African scale. This stresses the need to strengthen the protection status of this wetland and mitigate degradation sources that threaten wintering waterfowl.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0152-y,avianres.biomedcentral.com,blanche,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.17618895366686,"['shelduck', 'tadorna tadorna']",1100

In this study, we assessed the citywide relationship between two anthropogenic noise variables (noise levels recorded during bird surveys and daily average noise levels) and vegetation cover with bird species richness. This study was conducted in the city of Xalapa (Mexico) through a 114 citywide point-count survey. We recorded bird communities at each sampling site. We measured noise levels using a sound level meter while performing point-counts. Then, we generated a map of average daily noise of the city using an array of 61 autonomous recording units distributed across the city of Xalapa and calculated daily noise levels for the 114 points. We ran a linear model (LM) to assess potential relationships between both point-count and daily (24 h) noise values and vegetation cover with bird richness. Results from the LM show: (1) a negative relationship between maximum point-count noise and avian species richness, (2) no relationship between 24 h noise and bird species richness, and (3) a positive relationship between vegetation cover and bird species richness.

within  days. Mona monkeys were responsible for  (%)
of these events; the other predators could not be identified.
On  May , an active thrush nest (the fifth ever found)
was recorded on the slopes of Pico Príncipe, at . m height
within the trunk of a Pseudagrostistachys africana tree. The
nest was monitored with a camera trap during  May–
July. Images show adult thrushes occupying the nest until
 July. Mona monkeys inspected the nest on five separate
occasions. We were, however, unable to confirm the pres-
ence of eggs or chicks and therefore we could not determine
whether there had been a predation event.

Counting populations using un-crewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising approach to overcoming these difficulties. However, a careful validation of the approach is needed to ensure comparability with counts collected using conventional methods. Here, we report on surveys of three Antarctic bird species breeding on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands; Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) Penguins, and the South Georgia Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps georgianus). We show that images from low-altitude UAV surveys have sufficient resolution to allow separation of Chinstrap Penguins from contiguously breeding Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adéliae), which are very similar in appearance when viewed from overhead. We compare data from ground counts with manual counts of nesting birds on images collected simultaneously by low-altitude aerial photography from multi-rotor UAVs at the same colonies. Results at this long-term monitoring site confirmed a continued population decline for Chinstrap Penguins and increasing Gentoo Penguin population. Although both methods provided breeding pair counts that were generally within ~ 5%, there were significant differences at some locations. We examine these differences in order to highlight potential biases or methodological constraints that should be considered when analysing similar aerial census surveys and comparing them with ground counts.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-021-02831-6.pdf,link.springer.com,musafaq,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.19159000238132,"['leucocarbo atriceps', 'south georgia shag', 'gentoo penguin', 'pygoscelis antarctica', 'pygoscelis papua']",413

The Indonesian island of Sulawesi, lying at the heart of Wallacea, is famous for its unique array of species: at least 88 bird species are found nowhere else in the world. The majority of these endemics are restricted to the island's montane areas and has become familiar to birdwatchers visiting the impressive Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi (1-3). However, away from Lore Lindu, many mountain ranges remain little explored. A chain of mountains runs along almost the entire length of the northern peninsula of Sulawesi. In the west this forms the Tentolo-Matinan range and reaches heights of over 2,000 m, whilst to the east the huge Bogani Nani Wartabone (Dumoga Bone) National Park includes extensive areas of montane forest. The only recent surveys of these mountains revealed a diverse avifauna with many exciting endemics (4). To the east of the national park lies the small - 8,000 ha - Cagar Alam (Nature Reserve) Gunung Ambang. Like many reserves throughout Indonesia, Ambang has not been surveyed in detail and the biological diversity it supports has yet to be adequately documented. In November 1999 I led a team of scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society - Indonesia Program in Sulawesi on the first in-depth surveys to be conducted at the reserve. These led to the discovery of two of Sulawesi's threatened endemics - Matinan Flycatcher Cyornis sanfordi and the recently described Cinnabar Hawk Owl Ninox ios (5). We also found that the reserve was an excellent birding site, easy to reach from the provincial town of Kotamobagu, and a visit to Ambang could be combined with a stay at the Toraut research station at Dumoga Bone, already a popular location with birders.

Abundance of riparian-obligate birds in the breeding guild were positively associated with vegetation structure of dense, multi-canopy canopy and tall trees. Abundance of most bird guilds were positively associated with composition of tall trees (Populus fremontii, Salix gooddingii) and drought tolerant shrubs (Prosopis velutina, Celtis reticulata).

Here, through geometric morphometric tools and phenotypic selection analyses, we examined whether adaptation in flower shape and length occurred in Nicotiana glauca as a response to pollinator selection in contrasting pollination environments. We assessed populations of this plant species in the native range (South America), where plants depend on hummingbird pollination, and in two invaded areas, one where sunbirds act as pollinators (South Africa), and another where nectar feeding birds are absent and reproduction is entirely by autonomous self-pollination (Mallorca, Spain). Corolla length and shape varied significantly among pollination environments. Non-native sites were less variable and their range of variation fell within the native range of variation. Flower length in native populations and in a South African population matched the bill length of their respective pollinators. In contrast with the straight floral tubes in the native range, both non-native areas had significantly curved tubes. Curvature may improve the fit with the curved bills of sunbirds in South Africa (versus straight beaks of hummingbirds) and may enhance self-pollination in Mallorca, but this similarity between invaded areas may equally be due to drift and a shared colonization route. We found spatial variation in selection acting on corolla length but not on corolla shape. Overall, selection patterns were not consistent with floral trait variation. Although some results are consistent with both drift and selection, our study suggests that population divergence in flower shape and length is more likely the result of long-term diversifying pollinator-driven selection, which is difficult to detect by studying a single selection event.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10682-020-10082-w.pdf,link.springer.com,piedra,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.19855773757079,,568

The...",en,"Extinction, coextinction and colonization dynamics in plant–hummingbird networks under climate change","Climate-driven range shifts may cause local extinctions, while the accompanying loss of biotic interactions may trigger secondary coextinctions. At the same time, climate change may facilitate colonizations from regional source pools, balancing out local species loss. At present, how these extinction–coextinction–colonization dynamics affect biological communities under climate change is poorly understood. Using 84 communities of interacting plants and hummingbirds, we simulated patterns in climate-driven extinctions, coextinctions and colonizations under future climate change scenarios. Our simulations showed clear geographic discrepancies in the communities’ vulnerability to climate change. Andean communities were the least affected by future climate change, as they experienced few climate-driven extinctions and coextinctions while having the highest colonization potential. In North America and lowland South America, communities had many climate-driven extinctions and few colonization events. Meanwhile, the pattern of coextinction was highly dependent on the configuration of networks formed by interacting hummingbirds and plants. Notably, North American communities experienced proportionally fewer coextinctions than other regions because climate-driven extinctions here primarily affected species with peripheral network roles. Moreover, coextinctions generally decreased in communities where species have few overlapping interactions, that is, communities with more complementary specialized and modular networks. Together, these results highlight that we should not expect colonizations to adequately balance out local extinctions in the most vulnerable ecoregions. Using 84 plant–hummingbird networks from across the Americas, the authors show that the balance between climate change-induced extinction, coextinction and colonization varies both with geography and network structure.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01693-3.pdf,nature.com,coeligena,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-7.199745365606272,,23

Nam Theun 2, a major hydropower development proposal, has focused attention on an important protected area which might hold the key to conserving some of the rarest and most highly threatened species of birds and mammals in South-East Asia. This article summarises the significance of Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area in central Laos, sketches recent developments in the hydropower project, and looks to the future. Introduction Laos is a land-locked country separated from Vietnam by the Annamite mountains, an isolated range that is covered in several areas by huge tracts of relatively undisturbed montane evergreen forest. The largest of these, one of the most pristine wildernesses remaining in South-East Asia, is largely encompassed within Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA). A series of surveys conducted since 1994 by the co-operative programme of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the Centre for Protected Areas and Watershed Management (CPAWM) of the Lao Department of Forestry, and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) have revealed that the area has an extremely high biodiversity conservation value. Plans to develop a $2 billion hydropower project along the major river draining the area (the Nam Theun) have generated considerable controversy and promoted intensive research into the likely effects of such a development. Some of this research has been directed towards identifying appropriate mitigation for the damage that will inevitably be caused to the environment if a dam is built. Nakai-Nam Theun covers approximately 3,445 km2 of the Annamite mountains and the adjacent Nakai Plateau in the provinces of Khammouane and Bolikhamxay. A proposed northern extension along the Vietnam border in Bolikhamxay would link Nakai-Nam Theun to the Nam Chouan proposed NBCA, and a minor southern extension would make the area contiguous with Hin Namno NBCA, a bizarre karst landscape of limestone hills and one of the most important sites for primate conservation in Indochina (1). A third proposed corridor would annex the Khammouane Limestone NBCA to the west. These potential additions expand the size of the protected area to nearly 5,000 km2, encompassing altitudes between 400 m and 2,700 m and a broad variety of habitats and species assemblages (2). The potential result is a composite of seven protected areas bridging an international border: in Vietnam, Pu Mat, Vu Quang and Phong Nha reserves, and in Laos, Nam Chouan, Hin Namno and Khammouane Limestone NBCA's, with the hub of these being Nakai-Nam Theun. If managed wisely and effectively, this ësuper-reserve' would rank amongst the most important sites for biological and cultural conservation in the world (2). Red-tailed Minla © Joe Tobias Habitat
The area is described in detail by Evans and Timmins (3) and IUCN (2). Semi-evergreen forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest and stands of pine are all found on the Nakai Plateau (now heavily deforested by salvage logging prior to the planned inundation of the c. 450 km2 reservoir area) and in the Annamite foothills to the east, grading into more exclusively evergreen forests as the land rises towards the Vietnamese border. Higher still, huge areas of montane fagaceous forest cloak the slopes, interspersed with patches of Fokienia hodginsii, a commercially valuable cypress-like conifer. On mountain-tops and above c. 2,000 m the fagaceous forest gives way to more stunted, rhododendron-dominated ericaceous cloudforest. A unique feature of Nakai-Nam Theun's proposed northern extension is the 'everwet' forests, found in narrow bands where low-elevation saddles (500-800 m) in the mountain chain enable the Vietnamese north-east monsoon to penetrate across the border, a phenomenon otherwise impeded by higher stretches of the Annamites.",,orientalbirdclub.org,fireback,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.2149838289263,,1000

These models also account for survey bias and imperfect detection through the use of a hierarchical modelling framework that separately estimates the species–environment response and detection process. This is particularly helpful for conservation applications and predictions for rare species, where data are often limited and prediction errors may have significant management consequences. Despite this potential importance, ISDMs remain largely untested under a variety of scenarios. We performed an exploration of key modelling decisions and assumptions on an ISDM using the endangered Baird’s tapir (Tapirus bairdii) as a test species. We found that site area had the strongest effect on the magnitude of population estimates and underlying intensity surface and was driven by estimates of model intercepts. Selecting a site area that accounted for the individual movements of the species within an average home range led to population estimates that coincided with expert estimates. ISDMs that do not account for the individual movements of species will likely lead to less accurate estimates of species intensity (number of individuals per unit area) and thus overall population estimates. This bias could be severe and highly detrimental to conservation actions if uninformed ISDMs are used to estimate global populations of threatened and data-deficient species, particularly those that lack natural history and movement information. However, the ISDM was consistently the most accurate model compared to other approaches, which demonstrates the importance of this new modelling framework and the ability to combine opportunistic data with systematic survey data. Thus, we recommend researchers use ISDMs with conservative movement information when estimating population sizes of rare and data-deficient species. ISDMs could be improved by using a similar parameterization to spatial capture–recapture models that explicitly incorporate animal movement as a model parameter, which would further remove the need for spatial subsampling prior to implementation.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4F7145F50BC44EDBF5B89E3832658CD6/S0376892919000055a.pdf/div-class-title-a-sensitivity-analysis-of-the-application-of-integrated-species-distribution-models-to-mobile-species-a-case-study-with-the-endangered-baird-s-tapir-div.pdf,cambridge.org,centroamericano,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.22020222141204,,962

Although pesticide application is beneficial to crop production by serving several significant purposes, like protection against vector-borne diseases and crop loss, there are substantial concerns as they have a persistent nature and can possess serious consequences because of harmful effects to non-targeted beings comprising humans also. Pesticide consumption has reached 4.1 million tonnes/year in 2017 almost 81% from 1990. Recent data suggest pesticides account for 14–20% of global suicides from 2006 to 2015 resulting in 111,000–168,000 deaths annually from 2010 to 2014. About 14 million people have died from suicide by consuming pesticides since the beginning of the Green revolution. About 1 million accidental pesticide poisoning occur each year causing 20,000 fatalities approximately. For this reason, the occurrence of pesticides in different mediums like crop, air, water resources, fruits and vegetables, soil, plants, birds, animal products, and human beings was reviewed. This paper presents an overview of pesticides occurrence, distribution, extraction method, analytical techniques for their detection. This review will assist policymakers to enforce guidelines to restrict the redundant use of pesticides.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10668-021-01722-4.pdf,link.springer.com,bassan,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.22832969940897,,252

There is one confirmed record each from mainland Sumatra and Kalimantan.",en,Lost birds — Oriental Bird Club,"by S.H.M. Butchart, N.J. Collar, M.J. Crosby and J.A. Tobias from BirdingASIA 3, June 2005. The rediscovery of Cebu Flowerpecker Dicaeum quadricolor, by Rob Timmins and others in 1992 on the Philippine island of Cebu (Dutson et al. 1993), was an extraordinary event. The bird had not been seen for 86 years, and had been written off as extinct at least 40 years earlier on the presumption that no forest remained on the island (see Collar 1998; also Magsalay et al. 1995). Six years later, Jon Riley and Jim Wardill finally tracked down the long-tailed blue flycatcher they had been searching for on-and-off for four years on the Indonesian island of Sangihe (Riley & Wardill 2001). In doing so, they put Caerulean Paradise-flycatcher Eutrichomyias rowleyi , firmly back on the ornithological map. It had previously been known only from an 1878 type specimen and a belatedly published sight record in 1978, and had been presumed extinct following fruitless searches in 1985–1986 (Whitten et al. 1987). Similarly, Jerdon's Courser Rhinoptilus bitorquatus was rediscovered in 1986 in Andhra Pradesh, India, following a coordinated campaign led by the Bombay Natural History Society, with 86 years - like the Cebu Flowerpecker - without a record (Bhushan 1986). Most recently, in February 2005, Ben King (in litt. 2005) and Julian Donahue rediscovered Rusty-throated Wren Babbler Spelaeornis badeigularis, about 50 km from where the type specimen was collected in 1947 (in the Mishmi Hills of eastern Arunachal Pradesh, India), the only previous record of this species. There are in fact a remarkable number of Asian species that were collected in the nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, and then not recorded for many decades before being rediscovered, or at least re-seen, as modern birdwatching took hold in the region. Examples include: Forest Owlet Athene blewitti (last collected 1884, rediscovered 1997); Damar Flycatcher Ficedula henrici (last collected 1898, next seen again 2001); White-tipped Monarch Monarcha everetti (last collected 1927, next seen again 1993); Black-chinned Monarch M. boanensis (collected 1918, next seen again 1991); Sangihe Shrike-thrush Colluricincla sanghirensis (collected 1878, next seen again 1985); White-browed Nuthatch Sitta victoriae (last recorded 1938, next seen again 1995); Sangihe White-eye Zosterops nehrkorni (collected 1886, next seen again 1996); and Rufous-throated White-eye Madanga ruficollis (collected 1922, next seen again 1995) (BirdLife International 2001, Trainor 2002). In most of these cases the ""rediscovery"" was mainly just a matter of re-visiting a remote island, but sometimes - as in the cases of Jerdon's Courser and Forest Owlet - the event is only the result of considerable initiative and endeavour. Rediscovering one of Asia's ""lost"" species must be in many birders' dreams. Fourteen such birds ripe for rediscovery, some of which remain unseen for over 150 years, are highlighted below. We outline in each case the historical range, details of the last sighting, and priorities for future searches. Birders tend to visit the same popular birding sites, but we strongly encourage people to venture into less known territory in order to track down some of these exciting and enigmatic birds. Such searches are prerequisites for their conservation. In addition, there are a number of species so poorly known we cannot even classify their conservation status. Such species are placed in the Data Deficient category on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2001). This applies in cases where there is insufficient information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of extinction risk. Generally we would not expect these species to prove to be threatened, but more information is needed to permit an adequate assessment. Here we list ten such species from the region for which birders' records could significantly improve our understanding of their ranges, habitats and threats, and hence help clarify their conservation status.",,orientalbirdclub.org,miniature-babbler,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.23637238316436,"['dicaeum quadricolor', 'cebu flowerpecker', 'rhinoptilus bitorquatus', 'wren', 'spelaeornis badeigularis', 'madanga ruficollis', 'athene blewitti', 'colluricincla sanghirensis', 'forest owlet', 'damar flycatcher', 'monarcha everetti', 'zosterops nehrkorni', 'eutrichomyias rowleyi', 'nuthatch', 'sitta victoriae', 'ficedula henrici', 'blue flycatcher']",1000

Here we outline the history and current best practice collection and curatorial methods for the nest collection of the Australian National Wildlife Collection (ANWC). We also describe an experiment conducted on nests in the ANWC using ultrasonic humidification to restore the shape of nests damaged by inappropriate storage. The experiment showed that damaged nests can be successfully reshaped to close to their original dimensions. Indeed, restored nests were significantly closer to their original shape than they were prior to restoration. Thus, even nests damaged by years of neglect may be fully incorporated into active research collections. Best practice techniques include extensive note taking and photography in the field, subsampling of nests that cannot or should not be collected, appropriate field storage, metadata management, and prompt treatment upon arrival at the collection facility. Renewed focus on nest collections should include appropriate care and restoration of current collections, as well as expansion to redress past underrepresentation. This could include collaboration with researchers studying or monitoring avian nesting ecology, and nest collection after use in bird species that rebuild anew each nesting attempt. Modern expansion of museum nest collections will allow researchers and natural history collections to fully realise the scientific potential of these complex and beautiful specimens.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00266-5,avianres.biomedcentral.com,d'oustalet,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.23647195377668,,300

However, only a few studies explored the role of this specific component in species with a large repertoire and high song complexity. Here, we investigate the potential role of trills in the territorial vocal response of males Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), a species with complex songs characterised by the frequent use and diversity of their trills. We performed playback experiments simulating territorial intrusion to test if trills signal aggressive motivation in this species. If so, we expected tested males to respond by changing their trill rate or frequency of trill use in songs, and/or using different trill types than before the stimulation. Contrary to our expectation, males did not modify their trill rate or differed in trill type use before, during or after playback. There was a tendency for decrease in trill duration and the number of elements in the trills during the playback stimulation, reflecting to some extent the overall use of shorter songs by males during that stage of the experiment. Altogether, our study does not support the role of trills as motivation signals for territory defence in Thrush Nightingales, but advocates for more research on their potential roles in signalling other information.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01879-9.pdf,link.springer.com,nightingale-wren,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.24400747399507,"['thrush nightingale', 'luscinia luscinia']",382

Introduction Taiwan, a jewel in the Western Pacific Taiwan is located on the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, lying about 160 km off the south-east China coast between Japan and the Philippines. It is about 400 km long from north to south, 150 km at its widest point near the centre, 36,000 km² in area and with 1,000 km of coastline it is about half the size of Sri Lanka. An immense, very scenic mountain range rising to 3,998 m at Yushan (formerly Mount Morrison) and with 15 major peaks above 3,500 m makes up its spine, which lies closer to the east coast where the lower slopes fall steeply to the sea, whereas in the west they descend to a wide fertile densely populated and developed agricultural plain where the bulk of the more than 20 million human inhabitants live. The wetland areas of the west coast are very important stop-over and wintering areas for thousands of north-south migrant waterbirds, and the numerous scattered uninhabited offshore islets attract pelagic species that roost and nest. The mountains may be cool and wet at any time of year, and snow may be expected at high altitudes in winter. The summer is hot and humid at low altitude and the wettest time of year. The main season for tropical storms (typhoons) is from July to November. Winter is cool and wet in the north, cool and dry in the south. The islands location on the edge of the Eurasian tectonic plate means that earth tremors are frequent but not usually serious, although more severe earthquakes are not unknown, the last serious one (Richter 7.3) in October 1999 causing serious damage in the mountains. The long isolation of Taiwan since the Ice Ages has resulted in 15 endemic species (see Appendix) and around 70 endemic subspecies within the 550 bird species so far recorded. Other rare and interesting species the visitor may hope to see include Chinese Egret Egretta eulophotes, Black-faced Spoonbill Platalea minor, Saunders's Gull Larus saundersi, Chinese Crested Tern Sterna bernsteini, Malayan Night Heron Gorsachius melanolophus and, in summer, the Fairy Pitta Pitta nympha. Planning a visitGeneral information Taiwan has a wide range of facilities to suit all tastes and budgets. Transportation to most sites is straightforward, car hire is readily available, and food and accommodation are normally easy to find, although as detailed under specific sites it is sometimes necessary to arrange accommodation in advance and to carry snacks. Visitors should take clothing for all conditions and be prepared to accept the loss of one or two days birdwatching due to poor weather in the mountains or if the island is hit by a typhoon.

We captured birds during the breeding season in parks and greenspaces in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA, to evaluate overall tick infestation patterns and to determine if urbanization influences infestation prevalence (the proportion of birds parasitized) and intensity (the number of ticks on infested birds). Of 459 birds, 111 (24.2%) had ≥ 1 tick, a high proportion of infestation compared with past North American studies. The most frequently infested species were Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus; 56%), Brown Thrasher (Toxostoma rufum; 37%), and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis; 27%). The Lone Star Tick (Amblyomma americanum) comprised half (51%; n = 322) of all ticks on birds; other species sampled included Gulf Coast Tick (A. maculatum) (36%) and Rabbit Tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) (13%). Urbanization intensity (i.e., the percentage of developed land around sites) was inversely related to infestation prevalence for all birds combined and for Carolina Wren, but intensity of infestation was unrelated to urbanization. Our results suggest that non-migratory and migratory birds during sedentary periods are important carriers of ticks in urban areas, and that tick infestation patterns can be influenced by the level of urbanization in the surrounding landscape. Clarifying how urban birds influence tick populations, and how urbanization shapes bird-tick interactions, will increase understanding of tick-borne disease ecology in urban ecosystems.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11252-021-01160-0.pdf,link.springer.com,triste,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.264634207866729,"['toxostoma rufum', 'northern cardinal', 'thryothorus ludovicianus', 'brown thrasher', 'carolina wren', 'cardinalis cardinalis']",226

A conspicuous feature of this species is colour polymorphism of the elytra. In its native area, the populations consist of a recessive non-melanic morph, several dominant melanic morphs and small numbers of other (rare) morphs. The morph proportions in native populations have been intensively studied and vary with geographic area, climate and time. In contrast, colour polymorphism in invaded regions has been little studied. We examine and try to account for the morph frequencies observed across the different invaded regions. In America, monomorphic populations consist of the non-melanic morphs while European populations contain also melanic morphs. In particular geographic areas of Europe, the average percentage of the non-melanic morphs varied between 78 and 99%. It was highest in the lowlands of northern Italy and central and northern Europe and decreased in the Alps and western (Spain, UK) and eastern (southeast Russia) margins of the recently invaded area. In central Europe the frequency of the non-melanic morphs decreased over the course of the year but increased over the years from 2010 to 2018. The local differences might thus arise through gradual change of the morph composition of the founder invasive, non-native population. However, the variation in non-melanic morph frequency was not correlated with climatic characteristics that might affect coccinellid polymorphism. The observed rate of change in morph proportions in our data was too small to explain the diversification of what was supposedly a uniform invasive, non-native population at the point of introduction.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10530-020-02238-0.pdf,link.springer.com,chino,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.26901887284167,['harlequin'],768

Northumberland, Cumberland and Durham were the only counties to report an increase. The areas of maximum population (41-50 pairs per 100 sq. miles) appear to be Anglesey, Devon, Durham and parts of Essex, Suffolk and Hertford, and that of minimum population (0-5 pairs per 100 sq. miles), a mountainous area of north-east Lancashire and north-west Riding. About 4,000 naturalists took part in this census, organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and found about 12,000 breeding pairs for England and Wales in the summer of 1932, non-breeding birds averaging one per 50 sq. miles. Some 45,000 eggs were laid in 1932, of which 35,000 hatched and 33,000 owlets left the nest, when the country would contain 55,000 barn-owls, which, by the following spring, would be reduced to 24,000. The species seems to have declined 50 per cent in the past ten years, and is declining at about 1,000 a year, or four per cent. Of 214 nests examined, 807 eggs were laid, 174 of which failed to hatch, and of the 633 owlets, 594 left the nest. There is a marked spreading over the countryside at the end of the nesting season, which accounts for the presence of the birds in areas otherwise rarely inhabited. Mr. Blaker considers that the decline of the species could be averted if four per cent of the death-rate was stopped. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is to issue the complete census results in pamphlet form. The barn-owl, which was once the commonest owl in “Britain, is nowhere now so numerous as the tawny-owl, nor in many places as the alien little owl. The food of the barn-owl consists of 69 per cent voles and mice (Collinge).",,nature.com,barn-owl,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.26933729395366,"['little owl', 'tyto alba']",1000

Most West African studies have reported on the parasitic nature of the relationship between Tapinanthus dodoneifolius mistletoes and Parkia biglobosa trees. However, there is little on bird species’ use and subsequent dispersal of the mistletoe on P. biglobosa, and consequently, we investigated aspects of this relationship in the present study. We conducted our study in Amurum Forest Reserve, located in the central part of Nigeria, from May to September 2017. The study area consists of a mosaic of savanna, gallery forest, and rocky outcrops. Of the bird community in this area, the yellow-fronted Tinkerbird Pogoniulus chrysoconus had the highest number of visits to T. dodoneifolius fruits, while the Senegal Eremomela Eremomela pusilla spent the most time foraging on the fruits. Four sunbird species were recorded feeding on T. dodoneifolius flowers for nectar; all but the Copper Sunbird Cinnyris cupreus were observed opening the flowers of T. dodoneifolius. Other bird species were recorded foraging on insects on T. dodoneifolius, and some simply perching on twigs or pecking on mistletoe fruits. This was a mutualistic relationship between the respective bird species and the mistletoe. This indirectly benefitted the parasitised host by attracting potential pollinators, seed dispersers, and insectivores for the host, hence, improving the rate of visitation to the host. These patterns of visitation behaviours highlighted the ecological importance of T. dodoneifolius within the reserve, particularly in enhancing the survival of other taxa within the reserve.

Our analyses revealed a decline in vegetative regeneration of bamboo in recent years, which is mirrored by a decline in bamboo shoot consumption by primates; but an increase in proportional intake. Local declines in regeneration are potentially due to high intensities of herbivory, decreased amounts of rainfall during growing seasons, and natural processes that form part of the life cycle of bamboo. Moreover, spatial variation in bamboo regeneration can be explained by elevation, as well as by stand-level variation in soil acidity, vegetation density, and the density of dead bamboo culms.

Six genes, two mitochondrial and four nuclear, were analysed. All population splits were estimated to have occurred in the Pliocene–Pleistocene period, and the occurrence of an Amazon population split was supported by historical river dynamics. Amazonian populations were not monophyletic, and the eastern Amazonian cluster was a sister of the Atlantic Forest population. Molecular divergence occurring between the Amazonian and Atlantic forest populations was low when compared to splits between the lineages separated by Amazonian rivers. During the early to middle Pleistocene era, regions associated with mountain slopes and riverbanks connected the Amazonian and Atlantic Forest populations near the interior of the Brazilian Northeast semiarid region, which might have facilitated species dispersal from Amazonia into the Atlantic Forest. After this point, the populations were separated, and the Atlantic Forest population remained stable until the end of the Pleistocene and Holocene eras when short-range expansion and demographic growth occurred.

Synchronous seed production or masting in tropical montane cloud tree species is a widespread reproductive strategy of deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved tree associations to decrease costs of reproduction and ensure offspring. Masting event maintains a high avian diversity, which can be modified by phenological process (seed production and non-seed production). The main aim of this study was to assess alpha and beta avian diversity and whether the composition of the trophic guild modifies among phenological processes and between two fragmented relict-endangered Mexican Beech (Fagus grandifolia subsp. mexicana) forests (Medio Monte and El Gosco) in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. In addition, we evaluated beechnut production. We recorded 36 bird species, 11 of them included in some conservation risk status, and 5 endemic species. Alpha diversity values were dissimilar in avian richness (q = 0) among phenological processes and between fragmented beech forests. Avian communities among three phenological processes and between fragmented forests were structurally similar, dominated during immature seeds the Brown-backed Solitaire (granivores–insectivores–frugivores); during mature seeds the White-crowned Parrot (Pionus senilis, granivores–frugivores); and the Dwarf Jay (Cyanolyca nana, insectivores) was abundant during low seed quality. The complementarity index was high among phenological processes and low between forests. We found a high bird turnover value between immature seeds—mature seeds and during mature seeds—low seed quality. Furthermore, a similar pattern was recorded between the two study forests. Seed production showed a high number of undamaged beechnuts in Medio Monte, while in El Gosco beechnuts were attacked by insects. Our results reflect that masting phenological process and contrasting study forests’ structure influence the shifts in alpha and beta diversity of seed and non-seed bird consumers.

Adult tree and seedling density were important covariates when associated to floristic composition. Models including floristic composition, BA and DBH ranked high in explaining Oryzomys couesi occurrence. For Hodomy alleni, occupancy models suggest that tidal variation and BA have a significant impact on their occurrence probability as the Akaike weight and ΔAIC sustained (w > 0.13; ΔAIC < 2). Our results suggested that mangrove species composition, stand structure and daily tide significantly explained rodents’ occupancy. Contrary to our expectations, rodents did not prefer higher floristic richness nor more mature mangrove forest stands. Our results also revealed the ability of O. couesi to change its patterns of occurrence associated to seasonal flooding conditions, but only in mangrove zones where water conditions rise and fall, suggesting an adaptation to daily tidal fluctuations.

However, substantial variation exists among species in diet, foraging techniques and social structure of populations.

We find evidence for a variety of innovative foraging behaviors, scrounging tactics, collective problem-solving abilities and tool-use, skills that are considered indicative of enhanced cognition and that bear clear connections with the eco-social lifestyles of species. However, we also find that the cognitive basis of these skills remain insufficiently studied, and identify new research areas that require further attention in the future.

The specific properties and minimum information requirements of list items need to be defined, and a process for ensuring accuracy, consistency, and noting uncertainties, needs to be adopted. Perhaps the greatest technical challenge is in developing the procedures by which the global list is created, updated, and maintained. Considerations of how to incorporate obscure and newly described taxa, the extent and specific implementation of a review process, and mechanisms for arbitrating disputes or alternative taxonomic viewpoints will need to be addressed through an open and transparent process with broad engagement from multiple communities.

Under controlled conditions, GM-treated locusts and grasshoppers attract predators, a complementary advantage in locust control. We assessed avian predation on a population of desert locusts in northern Niger aerially sprayed operationally with GM with 107 g viable conidia ha-1. Populations of adult locusts and birds and vegetation greenness were assessed simultaneously along two transects from 12 days before until 23 days after treatment. Common kestrels Falco tinnunculus and lanners F. biarmicus were the predominant avian predators. Regurgitated pellets and prey remains were collected daily beneath “plucking posts” of kestrels. Locusts started dying five days post-spray and GM had its maximum effect one-two weeks after the spray, with 80% efficacy at day 21. After spraying, bird numbers increased significantly (P<0.05) concurrent with decreasing desert locust densities. Locust numbers decreased significantly (P<0.001) with both time since spraying and decreasing greenness. Before spraying, kestrel food remains under plucking posts accounted for 34.3 ±13.4 prey items day-1, of which 31.0 ±11.9 were adult desert locusts (90.3%), reducing post-spray to 21.1 ±7.3 prey items day-1, of which19.5 ±6.7 were adult desert locusts (92.5%), attributable to decreased use of the plucking-posts by the kestrels rather than an effect of the spray. After spraying, kestrels took significantly (P<0.05) more larger female (75–80%) than smaller male (20–25%) locusts. Avian predation probably enhanced the impact of the GM on the desert locust population, especially by removing large adult females. No direct or indirect adverse side-effects were observed on non-target organisms including locust predators such as ants and birds. These substantial ecological advantages should also be considered when choosing between conventional chemical and biopesticide-based locust control.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244733&type=printable,journals.plos.org,pèlerin,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.33450553118222,"['kestrel', 'falco tinnunculus']",471

Programs of active captive breeding, together with careful genetic monitoring, can play an important role in facilitating the creation of source populations with genetic variability to aid the recovery of endangered species. Here, the genetic diversity and population structure of 86 Asian woolly-necked storks from three captive breeding programs [Khao Kheow Open Zoo (KKOZ) comprising 68 individuals, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo (NRZ) comprising 16 individuals, and Dusit Zoo (DSZ) comprising 2 individuals] were analyzed using 13 microsatellite loci, to aid effective conservation management. Inbreeding and an extremely low effective population size (Ne) were found in the KKOZ population, suggesting that deleterious genetic issues had resulted from multiple generations held in captivity. By contrast, a recent demographic bottleneck was observed in the population at NRZ, where the ratio of Ne to abundance (N) was greater than 1. Clustering analysis also showed that one subdivision of the KKOZ population shared allelic variability with the NRZ population. This suggests that genetic drift, with a possible recent and mixed origin, occurred in the initial NRZ population, indicating historical transfer between captivities. These captive stork populations require improved genetic variability and a greater population size, which could be achieved by choosing low-related individuals for future transfers to increase the adaptive potential of reintroduced populations. Forward-in-time simulations such as those described herein constitute the first step in establishing an appropriate source population using a scientifically managed perspective for an in situ and ex situ conservation program in Thailand.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223726&type=printable,journals.plos.org,woollyneck,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.33993559589389,['ciconia episcopus'],923

Conspecific live decoys played an important role in the trapping process, especially those with a high-ranking for dueling behavior and vocal performance.

However, red-crested cardinals are shy, cautious, open-area passerines that seldom perch on unknown objects. These were mostly captured in loop snares after they perched on tree branches used as triggers.

Using dummy experiments, we tested whether Eurasian Nuthatches (Sitta europaea, narrow the entrance hole of cavities) and Cinereous Tits (Parus cinereus, do not narrow the entrance hole, as a control) perform different nest defence behaviours against Common Chipmunks (Tamias sibiricus, small nest predator) and Red Squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris, larger nest predator). Both nuthatches and tits exhibited stronger response behaviours (high dummy response scores) against chipmunks than against squirrels. Compared with tits, nuthatches exhibited more aggressive behaviours to chipmunks, but their responses to squirrels were similar. Nest defence behaviours of nuthatches to chipmunks differed from tits, and the results suggested that nuthatches might estimate threat levels of nest predators according to their narrowed entrance-hole size.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00294-1,avianres.biomedcentral.com,ou,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.34870761509412,"['parus cinereus', 'sitta europaea']",169

This loss has been particularly severe in the UK with extensive localised extinctions. Following sympathetic management, reintroduction was undertaken at four Cumbria (northern UK) sites in 2007 with stock from a captive admixture population descended from Cumbrian and Scottish founders. Annual population monitoring of the reintroductions was undertaken. Nine years post-reintroduction, the level of population genetic variation was assessed using microsatellites. Variation in historical Cumbrian samples was determined using museum samples and Scottish samples from current populations were assayed to characterise natural population variation. Half of the Scottish sites also served as indicators of the alleles present in the founder populations. The genetic contribution of the founder populations allied to population size data allowed patterns of genetic variation to be modelled. Alleles from Cumbrian and Scottish founders are present in the reintroduced populations. The four sites have levels of variation akin to natural populations and exhibit differentiation as predicted by statistical modelling and comparable with natural populations. This suggests that reintroduction following captive breeding can produce self-sustaining populations with natural levels of genetic diversity. These populations appear to be undergoing the same evolutionary dynamics with bottlenecks and drift as natural populations. Implications for insect conservation Reintroduction of captive bred individuals is a viable strategy for producing populations with natural levels of genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics.

Analysis of molluscan remains and their associated habitats, through a patch-choice framework, indicated that, instead of practicing different foraging regimes relative to their location, windward and leeward groups targeted small Neritidae gastropods from habitats adjacent to their home site. Despite the broad environmental differences, similar subsistence strategies may have been adopted for multiple reasons. In our windward-leeward assemblages, we suggest that mollusc size is not the paramount driver of forager decision making. Through a foraging theory lens, mollusc rank is reinterpreted beyond body size in response to prey-specific biological and ecological factors, such as aggregation and predictability. We also consider that targeted exploitation of stable, reliable, and resilient prey populations may instead be indicative of a risk management strategy in marginal, high variance environments.

However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However, these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission follows a “complex contagion”, e.g. through individuals disproportionally copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fission–fusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03102-4.pdf,link.springer.com,vulturine,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.35583341501268,,144

Four of these were backcrosses, also confirming that wild Australian crane hybrids are fertile. Genetic analyses identified 10 times more hybrids than our accompanying visual field observations. Our analyses also provide the first definitive evidence that both brolgas and sarus cranes migrate between the Gulf Plains, the principal breeding area for sarus cranes, and major non-breeding locations on the Atherton Tablelands. We suggest that genetic analysis of shed feathers could potentially offer a cost-effective means to provide ongoing monitoring of this migration. The first observations of hybrids coincided with significantly increased opportunities for interaction between the two species when foraging on agricultural crops, which have developed significantly in the Atherton Tablelands flocking area since the 1960s.

Worldwide there are 22 species of Scrubfowl, found in Papua New Guinea, Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Nicobar Islands and the south-west Pacific. Scrubfowl are the only birds which do not brood their eggs using body heat. Some species use the heat of the sun for incubation, others use volcanic heat or the heat generated by rotting vegetation. Most Scrubfowl are mound builders, building enormous hills which can have a diameter of up to 10m and be 1-2m high. The internal temperature of the mound is regulated by adding, moving or removing sand and vegetation and digging holes. Uniquely, the Moluccan Scrubfowl, Eulipoa wallacei, just digs a hole, throws sand over the egg, then flies off, not even returning to check or regulate the incubation temperature. During Scrubfowl evolution several special adaptations have occurred to allow for this type of incubation. The eggs are very large and contain almost entirely yolk and have a very thin shell. The embryos have an egg tooth but this is lost before they hatch. The egg is also without an air chamber. The first breath is taken as soon as the shell is broken when the hatchling pushes itself out of the shell and digs its way to the surface. It is not in any hurry, because it still contains a large store of yolk and fat. Scrubfowl with their strange adaptations are fascinating from an evolutionary point of view. There is a theory that the birds first utilised piles of rotting leaves and holes in rotting trees to incubate their eggs then gradually evolved towards using volcanically warmed ground and warm beaches. Their reproductive strategy can be looked upon as being rather primitive and reptilian but they can also be regarded as progressive, a refinement on birds who sit on nests. However, the birds leave a beach full of holes and a clear indication of where the eggs have been laid: a larder which must and does attract predators like snakes, monitors, cats, pigs, feral dogs and rats. Birds of prey, such as the Brahminy Kite, Haliastur indus, also await the young as they struggle out of the sand and take a heavy toll of freshly emerged chicks. In June 1994 we arrived in the small Islamic village of Kailolo on the unspoilt island of Haruku, in order to spend more than a year researching the Moluccan Scrubfowl. Together with Galele (NE Halmahera) Haruku is probably the last big breeding colony of this species in the world. The Moluccan Scrubfowl lives in the impenetrable tropical rainforest on the mountain slopes of Haruku and the surrounding islands. Little is known about its breeding behaviour and the literature only mentions occasional incidental observations of the bird in its natural habitat. On Haruku we tried to gather as much information as possible on this unique bird, about which so little is known. We hoped that this knowledge might be of help to enable us to re-introduce the Moluccan Scrubfowl to areas where it has disappeared.",,orientalbirdclub.org,buru,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.37036644389461,"['eulipoa wallacei', 'brahminy kite', 'scrubfowl', 'moluccan scrubfowl', 'haliastur indus']",1000

We compared the dietary composition to that of its sympatric competitor, the Brown-cheeked Laughing Thrush (Trochalopteron henrici) that breeds twice a year. Female Grey-backed Shrikes produced a fixed clutch size of five, with increasing egg size by their laying sequence. The last offspring in the brood is disadvantageous in the size hierarchy because it hatches later. However, they had the largest fledgling body mass. These findings indicate that Grey-backed Shrikes adopt the brood survival strategy in both the egg and nestling phases. Moreover, males and females exhibit no sexual division in providing parental care as they made an equal contribution to the total amount of food delivered to their brood. This parenting pattern of Grey-backed Shrikes, as well as their dietary items, differ significantly from those of the Brown-cheeked Laughing Thrush.

A standardized, scientific process for assessing birdstrike risk could prevent accidents, thereby improving the flight safety and reducing economic losses. However, China currently lacks a unified birdstrike risk assessment system. Here, we propose and validate a new model for assessing birdstrike risk in order to fill that need. The model consists of two elements. First, empirical data are collected on the occurrence of birds at the airport and in a surrounding 8&nbsp;km buffer. Second, each species is evaluated with a risk assessment matrix that takes into account the number of birds, weight, flight altitude, a tendency to cluster, and range of activity. These five factors allow each species to be divided into one of three risk levels: high danger (level 3), moderate danger (level 2) and low danger (level 1). We propose corresponding birdstrike prevention measures for each level. We apply this method to the civil aviation airport in Ordos, China. We found that 20 of the 118 species of birds in and around the airport were high danger birds (level 3). To validate this process, we compared these species with records of birdstrike accidents in a database maintained by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for 2007–2016. We found that 42% of the species we identified as high risk had been involved in at least one birdstrike accident, and that the remaining 58% belonged to families that appeared in the database. The high degree of overlap gives us high confidence in the practicality of our risk assessment model, which is based on the risk management concept of ISO 31000. Critically, this new model and method for predicting bird strike risk can be replicated at other airports around the world, even where no extensive records have been kept of past birdstrikes.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76275-z.pdf,nature.com,demoiselle,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.38045161468818,,524

Objective We investigated whether and at which scale bird-seed-dispersal indicators (BSDI) based on species distribution models (SDMs), together with climatic and landscape structure metrics related to habitat preferences of birds, aid the explanation of the distribution of Viscum album. Methods We developed a set of BSDI (abundance, species richness, Turdus spp. richness, and specialization) at four different scales (500–3500 m). They served as predictors, along with other environmental variables, in generalized linear models to predict V. album distribution in Catalonia, Spain. Results The indicator Turdus spp. richness (3500 m) explained up to 15% of variance. This contribution was smaller when it was considered alongside other predictors, where climatic conditions and % of olive groves explained ca. 35% and 13% variance, respectively. The abundance or species richness BSDI proved to be poor predictors of V. album distribution. Conclusions We demonstrated the functionality of BSDI based on SDMs to predict the distribution of V. album and the importance to test them at different spatial scales. BSDI showed a clear larger effect with increasing scale, suggesting a strong link between the mobility of birds and the plant dispersal process.

We used dust collectors, trail cameras, and sweep-netting at increasing distances from unpaved roads to determine dust deposition, relative bird abundance, and invertebrate abundance, respectively. We found that traffic associated with fracking along unpaved roads emitted substantial dust 180 m into adjacent crop fields. But neither bird abundance or behavior, nor invertebrate abundance or community composition, appeared to be affected by dust or traffic.

Large-bodied psittacines frequently exhibit a narrow dietary niche with specific habitat use, but few studies have determined whether psittacines select food resources, and how this influences habitat use. We established fruiting phenology transects to evaluate food resource availability for the large-bodied Military Macaw (Ara militaris) in semi-deciduous, deciduous, and pine-oak forest at two sites along the coast of Jalisco, during the dry season when macaws are nesting. We also determined Military Macaw diet by observations of foraging macaws along transect routes, and conducted bromatological analysis of the nutritional content of the most consumed resource. Military Macaws used six plant species as food items during the dry season, and had a narrow dietary niche (Levins’ B = 0.28), with 56% of foraging macaws consuming the seeds of Hura polyandra. No food resources were recorded in pine-oak forest during the dry season, with food resources and foraging by macaws concentrated in tropical deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, where H. polyandra was the most abundant fruiting tree species. When considering the proportional availability of food resources, we determined a broad Hurlbert dietary niche breadth of H = 0.67, indicating that Military Macaws consumed food resources according to their availability. Furthermore, the seeds of H. polyandra were an important source of protein, carbohydrates, minerals and moisture, and the hard fruit-casing means that these seeds are exclusively available for macaws. By concentrating their diet on the most abundant resources, Military Macaws may increase foraging efficiency in the dry season. The high nutrient content also means that concentrating the diet on seeds of H. polyandra may be an optimal foraging strategy for Military Macaws to meet their energy requirements during the breeding season.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0177-2,avianres.biomedcentral.com,saunders,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.40502582741362,"['ara militaris', 'military macaw']",919

Yet, few U.S. studies have analyzed the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) on a national or local scale. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined the trends associated with IWT moving through personal baggage. This work aimed to better understand the magnitude of illegal wildlife importation into U.S. ports of entry by determining trends associated with illegal wildlife products from personal baggage seizures, using the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a specific case study. To identify the most influential factors determining the numbers and types of personal baggage seizures into PNW, we analyzed 1,731 records between 1999 and 2016 from the Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) database. We found five significant contributors: taxonomic classification of wildlife, categorical import date, wildlife product, source region, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) status. While wildlife seizures across taxonomic categories have generally decreased in the PNW since 2008, other findings provide a reason for concern. More specifically, mammals were identified as the largest animal group of seized wildlife, and temporal trends indicate increases in seizures for this and several other taxonomic groups. Many of the seizures originated from overseas, with East Asia serving as the largest source. Our PNW case study can be a model for how large-scale geographical seizure data can be used to inform about the major factors that have historically and presently contribute to IWT, with conservation implications globally.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234197&type=printable,journals.plos.org,jejeel,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.40821352804072,,679

Nonetheless, scarce evidence suggests that the Helmeted Manakin Antilophia galeata, the only dichromatic manakin widely distributed in the South American Cerrado, is monogamic. We studied the breeding biology of the Helmeted Manakin in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. We found 17 nests, which are built in the forest undergrowth (usually below 3 m height). Nests are a cup attached by its top lip usually in the angle of a forked branch. The nest attachment zone is made mostly of spider silk. The structural zone is constructed with dry broad leaves, leaf petioles and horsehair fungus, which were bind together by a considerable amount of spider silk. The outer (decorative) zone is made with some hanging dry broad leaves, frequently forming a tail. Clutch size is always two (n = 12), and eggs are long oval, with a ground color in different shades of beige, marked with irregular spot, blotches and, sometimes, streaks ranging from light to dark brown. Mean eggs measurements were 23.9 x 16.3 mm (n = 14), weighting 3.3 g (n = 10). Eggs are laid once each day and hatching is synchronous. Females are the sole responsible for nest building (which usually took 10 days), incubation (18.5 days), and nestling care (18.3 days). The simple percentage of successful nests (n = 11) was 27% and predation was the main cause of nest failure. The breeding season extends from the second half of August to the first half of January. Renesting after loss of a first clutch is a common strategy and we recorded up to three nesting attempts for a single female.

However, the factors predicting this variation are still unclear. In this study, we assessed whether individual characteristics (rank, social integration, sex) and species socio-ecological characteristics (dietary breadth, group size, domestication) predicted variation in neophobia. For this purpose, we conducted behavioral observations and experimental tests on 78 captive individuals belonging to 10 different ungulate species—an ideal taxon to study inter-specific variation in neophobia given their variety in socio-ecological characteristics. Individuals were tested in their social groups by providing them with familiar food, half of which had been positioned close to a novel object. We monitored the individual latency to approach and eat food and the proportion of time spent in its proximity. Using a phylogenetic approach and social network analyses, we showed that across ungulate species neophobia was higher in socially more integrated individuals, as compared to less integrated ones. In contrast, rank and sex did not predict inter-individual differences in neophobia. Moreover, species differed in their levels of neophobia, with Barbary sheep being on average less neophobic than all the other study species. As group size in Barbary sheep was larger than in all the other study species, these results support the hypothesis that larger group size predicts lower levels of neophobia, and confirm ungulates as a highly promising taxon to study animal behavior and cognition with a comparative perspective. Significance statement In several species, individuals may respond fearfully to novel stimuli, therefore reducing the risks they may face. However, it is yet unclear if certain individuals or species respond more fearfully to novelty. Here, we provided food to 78 individual ungulates with different characteristics (e.g., sex, rank, social integration, group size, domestication, dietary breadth) in different controlled conditions (e.g., when food was close to novel or to familiar objects). Across species, we found that socially integrated individuals responded more fearfully in all species.

However, improvements in both video monitoring and temperature logging devices present an opportunity to increase our understanding of this aspect of avian behavior. To investigate nest attentiveness behaviors and evaluate these technologies, we monitored 13 nests across two Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) breeding colonies with a paired video camera - temperature logger approach, while monitoring 63 additional nests with temperature loggers alone. Observations occurred from May to August of 2017 on Poplar (Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA) and Skimmer Islands (Isle of Wight Bay, Maryland, USA). We examined data respective to four times of day: Morning (civil dawn‒11:59), Peak (12:00‒16:00), Cooling (16:01‒civil dusk), and Night (civil dusk‒civil dawn). While successful nests had mostly short duration off-bouts and maintained consistent nest attentiveness throughout the day, failed nests had dramatic reductions in nest attentiveness during the Cooling and Night periods (p < 0.05) with one colony experiencing repeated nocturnal abandonment due to predation pressure from a Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). Incubation appeared to ameliorate ambient temperatures during Night, as nests were significantly warmer during Night when birds were on versus off the nest (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, off-bouts during the Peak period occurred during higher ambient temperatures, perhaps due to adults leaving the nest during the hottest periods to perform belly soaking. Unfortunately, temperature logger data alone had limited ability to predict nest attentiveness status during shorter bouts, with results highly dependent on time of day and bout duration. While our methods did not affect hatching success (p > 0.05), video-monitored nests did have significantly lower clutch sizes (p < 0.05). The paired use of iButtons and video cameras enabled a detailed description of the incubation behavior of COTE.

Shade is an important determinant that structures arid ecosystem processes and functioning. While shade is considered an essential refuge for many organisms in arid environments, few studies have assessed how parasitic plants such as aerial mistletoes can influence the quality of shade provided by its host, and how this can subsequently influence species interactions. Here, we investigate how mistletoe influences the microclimate and daytime use of sub-canopy habitat by a large herbivore that seeks out shady micro-habitats to avoid daytime heat in Australia’s Strzelecki Desert. We experimentally removed the pale-leaved mistletoe (Amyema maidenii) from mulga trees (Acacia aneura) and monitored sub-canopy ambient temperatures and the daytime use of sub-canopy habitat by red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus). Results showed that average hourly temperature during the daytime and daily maximum temperature were cooler and that kangaroos were approximately three times more likely to shelter beneath trees where mistletoe was present (control) compared to where mistletoes had been removed (treatment). By showing that mistletoe can improve the quality of shade provided by their host trees, our study offers a novel insight into how mistletoes can facilitate the surrounding biota through modifying the abiotic environment beyond its physical structure. More broadly, the results of our study emphasise the prevalence of positive interactions within ecological communities and how they can occur in unexpected ways and indirectly between organisms that never come into direct contact.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10021-020-00590-9.pdf,link.springer.com,corythaixoides,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-7.439127870373989,,447

While eavesdropping is common, this indirect public information is often less reliable than direct predator observations. Red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) eavesdrop on chickadee mobbing calls and vary their behaviour depending on the threat encoded in those calls. Whether nuthatches propagate this indirect information in their own calls remains unknown. Here we test whether nuthatches propagate direct (high and low threat raptor vocalizations) or indirect (high and low threat chickadee mobbing calls) information about predators differently. When receiving direct information, nuthatches vary their mobbing calls to reflect the predator’s threat. However, when nuthatches obtain indirect information, they produce calls with intermediate acoustic features, suggesting a more generic alarm signal. This suggests nuthatches are sensitive to the source and reliability of information and selectively propagate information in their own mobbing calls. Animals can obtain information on predation risk directly from observing predators or indirectly from the alarm calls of others. Here, the authors show that red-breasted nuthatches encode information on risk in their own alarm calls differently depending on the source of the information.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14414-w.pdf,nature.com,solitaire,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.44681521152864,['sitta canadensis'],814

Examining the mechanisms underlying the coexistence or segregation of congeneric species requires detailed data on aspects of their ecology such as their feeding behaviour or habitat use. Endemic island birds, such as the vangas of Madagascar, are good candidates for studying processes of niche segregation. Vangas underwent rapid speciation following the initial colonization of the island by a shared ancestor and now provide a prime example of adaptive radiation, with considerable variation in body size and shape. Four small species of Newtonia are an exception to this variation, as they show morphological overlap and partial spatial range sympatry.

Nevertheless, the degree of spatial range congruence characterizing these groups of species is rarely used as an explicit parameter. Methods conceived for the identification of patterns of shared ranges often suffer from scale bias associated with the use of grids, or the incapacity to describe the full complexity of patterns, from core areas of high spatial congruence, to long gradients of range distributions expanding from these core areas. Here, we propose a simple analytical method, Spatial Congruence Analysis (SCAN), which identifies chorotypes by mapping direct and indirect spatial relationships among species. Assessments are made under a referential value of congruence as an explicit numerical parameter. A one-layered network connects species (vertices) using pairwise spatial congruence estimates (edges). This network is then analyzed for each species, separately, by an algorithm which searches for spatial relationships to the reference species. The method was applied to two datasets: a simulated gradient of ranges and real distributions of birds. The simulated dataset showed that SCAN can describe gradients of distribution with a high level of detail. The bird dataset showed that only a small portion of range overlaps is biogeographically meaningful, and that there is a large variation in types of patterns that can be found with real distributions. Species analyzed separately may converge on similar or identical groups, may be nested in larger chorotypes, or may even generate overlapped patterns with no species in common. Chorotypes can vary from simple ones, composed by few highly congruent species, to complex, with numerous alternative component species and spatial configurations, which offer insights about possible processes driving these patterns in distinct degrees of spatial congruence. Metrics such as congruence, depth, richness, and ratio between common and total areas can be used to describe chorotypes in detail, allowing comparisons between patterns across regions and taxa.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245818&type=printable,journals.plos.org,inezia,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.47076443729175,,335

Concisely ...",en,Males and females of a polygamous songbird respond differently to mating opportunities,"Abstract Parents are expected to make fine-tuned decisions by weighing the benefits of providing care to increase offspring survival against that of deserting to pursue future mating opportunities. A higher incentive for the rarer sex in the population indicates an impact of mating opportunities on parental care decisions. However, in a dynamic breeding system, deserting the offspring and searching for a new mate would influence mating opportunities for both sexes. Sex-specific costs and benefits are expected to influence males’ and females’ parenting strategies in different ways. Here, we investigated Chinese penduline tits, Remiz consobrinus, which exhibit flexible parental care strategies: uniparental care by the male or female, biparental care, and biparental desertion occur in the same population. We show that male penduline tits change their parental behavior over the breeding season; they desert clutches produced early in the season but care for the late season clutches. The change in male parenting behavior is consistent with the seasonal decline in mating opportunities. In contrast, parenting by females did not change over the breeding season, nor was it associated with seasonal variation in mate availability. Taken together, mating opportunities have different associations with parental behavior of male and female Chinese penduline tits. We recommend an inclusion of mating opportunities for both sexes simultaneously in order to understand one of the fundamental decisions in parental care evolution—care or desert. Significance statement Divorce is a common feature of both human and nonhuman animal societies. Theoretical studies suggest that one of the drivers of divorce is enhanced mating opportunity, i.e., parents with higher mating opportunities are more likely to abandon their family than those with low mating opportunities. Here, we investigate the dynamics of parental behavior and mating opportunities in a wild population of a small songbird, the Chinese penduline tit Remiz consobrinus. This species exhibits one of the most diverse avian breeding systems wherein both uniparental (male or female) and biparental rearing can be seen in a single population. We show that male penduline tits abandon their offspring in response to enhanced mating opportunities while the female parental behavior remains unaffected. This implies the relationship between mating opportunities and parental care is more complex than currently acknowledged and requires further investigation.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03000-9.pdf,link.springer.com,penduline-tit,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.47184070870183,"['chinese penduline tit', 'remiz consobrinus']",391

It remains less clear, however, just how parasites are able to recognize their hosts and identify the exact location of the appropriate nests to lay their eggs in. While previous studies attributed high importance to visual signals in finding the hosts’ nests (e.g. nest building activity or the distance and direct sight of the nest from vantage points used by the brood parasites), the role of host acoustic signals during the nest searching stage has been largely neglected. We present experimental evidence that both female and male common cuckoos Cuculus canorus pay attention to their host’s, the great reed warbler’s Acrocephalus arundinaceus alarm calls, relative to the calls of an unparasitized species used as controls. Parallel to this, we found no difference between the visibility of parasitized and unparasitized nests during drone flights, but great reed warblers that alarmed more frequently experienced higher rates of parasitism. We conclude that alarm calls might be advantageous for the hosts when used against enemies or for alerting conspecifics, but can act in a detrimental manner by providing important nest location cues for eavesdropping brood parasites. Our results suggest that host alarm calls may constitute a suitable trait on which cuckoo nestlings can imprint on to recognize their primary host species later in life. Our study contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding the context-dependency of animal signals, by providing a novel example of a beneficial acoustic trait intercepted by a heterospecific and used against the emitter.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54909-1.pdf,nature.com,attila,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-7.471923012820107,"['acrocephalus arundinaceus', 'great reed warbler', 'cuckoo', 'cuculus canorus']",866

though A. a. sharpii is closer geographically. The results demonstrate that failure to detect

Poole, from OBC Bulletin 30, November 1999. Introduction
On 25th January 1998 I was asked to identify a pair of partridges bought some days earlier at Sre Khlong, a Cambodian wildlife market situated on Highway 4 in Kompong Speu province, south of Phnom Penh. The 'pair' proved to be one Scaly-breasted Partridge Arborophila charltonii and one Chestnut-headed Partridge A. cambodiana. The latter is a globally threatened species, endemic to the Cardamom mountain chain of south-west Cambodia and south-east Thailand, and this was the first Cambodian record since 1936. Both birds had apparently been caught in the vicinity of Kirirom National Park, from where much of the wildlife at Sre Khlong is sourced. If so, this record would represent a range extension for the species. I was able to take several photographs, which I believe to be the first ever taken of this species. Unfortunately, both birds subsequently died and were disposed of. However, it prompted me to carry out a search of the literature to find out what was known of the history and status of Chestnut-headed Partridge. Chestnut-headed Partridge Arborophila (cambodiana) cambodiana © Colin Poole Discovery
Chestnut-headed Partridge was discovered in December 1927 when eight or nine specimens were collected from the Cambodian mountain of Bokor by P. Jabouille and Willoughby Prescott Lowe, members of the Fourth Franco-British Expedition to Indochina (1-4). It was described the following year by Delacour and Jabouille (2). Bokor was a French colonial hill station situated on a plateau at 1,000 m at the southern end of a mountain range known as the Cardamom, Elephant or Kravanh Mountains, stretching 330 km north-west to the Thai border, and this was the first-ever ornithological expedition to the area. At the time, Delacour described both the slopes and the plateau as being 'unspoiled', the slopes were covered with tall damp forest, whilst the summit plateau was 'very peculiar, the trees being rather low and stunted, with an abundance of orchids and other epiphytes' (3). It was in the latter area, on the plateau, that Chestnut-headed Partridge was collected. In 1928, Delacour and Jabouille described Chestnut-headed Partridge as 'a very distinct species' (2) and closer to Red-breasted Partridge A. hyperythra of Borneo than any of its continental congeners (1,3). However, in November 1930, Riley described a new species of partridge, A. diversa, on the basis of a single specimen collected in January 1930 by Dr H. M. Smith from semi-evergreen forest at 300 m at Khao Sabap (also known as Namtok Phliu National Park), Chanthaburi, Thailand (5) – the opposite end of the Cardamom mountain range. At the time, Riley had no specimens of Chestnut-headed Partridge available for comparison and his specimen did not agree with the published description, although he notes it as 'evidently closely allied' (5). Smith, on seeing the plate of Chestnut-headed Partridge published by Delacour and Jabouille in 1931 (p. 50) (6), later retracted A. diversa as a separate species, and in 1938 he described the two forms as subspecies, A. c. cambodiana and A. c. diversa. 7 This is their current taxonomic position, although there is still considerable debate over this view (8,9,10).",,orientalbirdclub.org,commune,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.4814075686253,"['arborophila charltonii', 'partridge']",1000

DNA barcoding was used to analyse the dietary composition of House Swifts (Apus nipalensis) in Hong Kong, China. Faecal samples from five different colonial nest sites were collected between 2019 and 2020. We used universal primers to amplify a region of the cytochrome C oxidase gene from prey DNA in the faecal samples for identification purposes. Ten different orders and 44 families from three different classes of Arthropoda were identified in the collected faecal samples. Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and Diptera were the most prevalent groups of prey found in the samples. Differences in the dietary composition of House Swifts during the breeding (April to September) and non-breeding (October to March) season were also found. Hymenoptera, particularly ants (Formicidae), were predominant in the diet during the breeding season, whereas Diptera and Hemiptera were predominant during the non-breeding season. The prey groups identified in this study were similar to those identified in a previous study of the diet of House Swift, which also suggests a possible role of House Swifts in reducing the numbers of local insect pests. This study demonstrates the usefulness of applying molecular tools for the dietary analysis of aerial feeders. Conserving local forested areas may be crucial for the maintenance of House Swift population.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00242-z,avianres.biomedcentral.com,pygmy-parrot,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.48402339784586,"['swift', 'house swift', 'apus nipalensis']",441

Poole, Jin-Young Park and Nial Moores, from OBC Bulletin 30, November 1999. In Birding Sites in Malaysia, supplement to OBC Bull. 20 (1), plate 4 is labelled as showing a Chinese Egret Egretta eulophotes feeding alongside a Pacific Reef Egret Egretta sacra (reproduced on page 39, photo 1). However, in our opinion, both birds in this photo are Chinese Egret, with the bird on the right being in non-breeding plumage. We believe that the same error is also made in the first edition of Birds: A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore (2), where the photograph labelled as Pacific Reef Egret (photo 3) shows a similar non-breeding plumage Chinese Egret. The photographer, Morten Strange, informs us that both pictures were taken over the period 8–10th April 1991, at the northern banks of the Seleta River estuary on the coastal side of Khtib Bongsu, Singapore. It appears that the identification of both birds was based primarily on bare-part coloration. However, we believe this should not be relied on for certain identification and it should only be used to support observations of more consistent structural characteristics. We base our re-identification largely on the following characteristics: Bill shape Chinese Egret typically has a more symmetrical bill, which is of a similar thickness for most of its length and only narrows in the last quarter towards the tip. This gives the bill a dagger-like profile. In Pacific Reef Egret the whole bill typically narrows gradually from the heavier-looking base. The culmen is rather more convex and the lower mandible straighter, with the upper mandible sometimes appearing to overlap the lower mandible at the tip. This gives the whole bill a rather more asymmetrical drooping, or droop-tipped, appearance. Leg length Pacific Reef Egret has noticeably shorter legs than Chinese Egret, particularly in the tibia. In Pacific Reef Egret the tibia is significantly shorter than the tarsus so that all of the 'leg-length' appears to be in the tarsus. The legs also appear stouter, with chunkier knees in Pacific Reef Egret. In Chinese Egret the tibia is longer than that of Pacific Reef Egret, giving the slender legs a more balanced, proportioned appearance.",,orientalbirdclub.org,aigrette,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.48718503085822,"['egretta eulophotes', 'egretta sacra', 'chinese egret']",1000

WTS foraged in restricted areas along their path, while TP predominantly foraged using extensive search behavior, suggesting a more opportunistic foraging strategy. Interspecific overlap of foraging areas was higher than intraspecific overlap. Breeding seasons largely overlap between species during the study, but TP seems to be asynchronous breeders. TP fed upon prey with higher δ15N values than WTS, and their diet was mainly composed of deep-sea organisms. TP could feed upon dead prey floating at the surface while WTS preyed mainly upon fish species that generally move in schools.

This isolated peripheral population has declined since the early twentieth century and is considered highly vulnerable to extirpation. We examined haplotype diversity of mitochondrial control region sequences, comparing modern Spruce Grouse populations sampled from 2004 to 2013 in the Adirondacks and Algonquin Provincial Park, ca. 250 km to the northwest. Genetic diversity in the modern Adirondack population sample was very low compared to our smaller sample from Algonquin Park (three haplotypes vs seven). The modern Adirondack population shared no haplotypes with birds sampled from Algonquin, and these two populations are highly differentiated today (Fst = 0.632). We obtained shorter control region sequences from 18 museum specimens collected in the Adirondack from 1881 to 1986, in which we found six haplotypes, including five no longer found in the Adirondack Region. Some haplotypes that were once found in both regions have been lost from the Adirondacks as that population has declined demographically and shrunk geographically, indicating that the current differentiation is partly the result of these losses; when all 18 historical samples of Adirondack Spruce Grouse are included in the analysis, Fst between Adirondacks and Algonquin drops to 0.359. Haplotype diversity in Adirondack specimens collected prior to demographic decline (1881–1905, n = 10) was h = 0.778 compared to h = 0.245 in the modern Adirondack population, an over a three-fold decrease over period of ca. 130 years.

In doing so, we consider the alignment between species-specific population recovery actions and broader ecosystem
restoration goals. Through semi-structured interviews with natural resource professionals (n = 32) in the Southeast
Coastal Plain of the United States, we examined manager perspectives on the evolution of recovery efforts and the
potential alignment of recovery efforts with other management goals and objectives on public lands.

In particular, they have the highest passerine bird density on the planet [ 22 ].

An approach to answering this question is to examine spatial patterns of coexistence among putatively competing species. The degree to which interspecies competition predominates in a community can have important effects on our ability predict the response of that community to perturbations, most notably climate change, when shifting species’ ranges may result in novel species assemblages. We present a study on the avifauna of the Eastern Himalayas. We hypothesize that in a community where competitive interactions predominate, there will be a relationship between pairwise altitudinal overlaps and morphological differences between species. Moreover, we hypothesize that both morphological traits and altitudinal traits depart from a Brownian motion evolution model, resulting in species trait covariances having a phylogenetic component. We find a significant relationship between morphological dissimilarity and altitudinal overlaps of species pairs. We also find that closely related species are significantly more altitudinally stratified than a null model would predict. However, as more distantly related species pairs are included in the analysis, this pattern disappears, indicating that competitive interactions predominate only in closely related species. This is further suggested by the fact that altitudinal ranges themselves are phylogenetically overdispersed at the genus level, as are morphological traits. This effect disappears when the entire phylogeny is examined, with morphology and altitude being phylogenetically underdispersed. Model fitting suggests that individual clades have evolved towards local clade-specific fitness peaks, while within-clade results show evidence of niche partitioning. We interpret these results as a tension between competition on shorter time scales and selection on longer time scales, where competition forces closely-related species away from fitness peaks in order to allow for niche separation and hence coexistence, suggesting that this effect is partially responsible for the recent diversification of Eastern Himalayan avifauna.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217549&type=printable,journals.plos.org,sibia,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.53474758451416,,1015

Plastic waste and debris have caused substantial environmental pollution globally in the past decades, and they have 
been accumulated in hundreds of terrestrial and aquatic avian species. Birds are susceptible and vulnerable to exter-
nal environments; therefore, they could be used to estimate the negative effects of environmental pollution. In this 
review, we summarize the effects of macroplastics, microplastics, and plastic-derived additives and plastic-absorbed 
chemicals on birds. First, macroplastics and microplastics accumulate in different tissues of various aquatic and ter-
restrial birds, suggesting that birds could suffer from the macroplastics and microplastics-associated contaminants 
in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Second, the detrimental effects of macroplastics and microplastics, and 
their derived additives and absorbed chemicals on the individual survival, growth and development, reproductive 
output, and physiology, are summarized in different birds, as well as the known toxicological mechanisms of plastics 
in laboratory model mammals. Finally, we identify that human commensal birds, long-life-span birds, and model bird 
species could be utilized to different research objectives to evaluate plastic pollution burden and toxicological effects 
of chronic plastic exposure.

These collaborations can be either mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. One of the best-known examples is the seabird–cetacean associations. Prey herding is the foraging tactic most used in these associations and consists of swimming around and under prey balls to trap them in the water column.

Although it is not yet clear whether this association is an opportunistic behavior of the European seabass or a mutualistic strategy used by both species to improve their catching success, this feeding association seems to increase the chances to defeat prey defense strategies.

Although neutral genetic variation can be informative for demographic inferences, it may be a poor predictor of adaptive genetic diversity and thus of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on selective evolutionary processes. In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeper Glyphorynchus spirurus. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. selection) may be different depending on loci considered. Finally, tick prevalence was higher in fragmented environments.

Background: While nest attentiveness plays a critical role in the reproductive success of avian species, nest atten-
tiveness data with high temporal resolution is not available for many species. However, improvements in both video 
monitoring and temperature logging devices present an opportunity to increase our understanding of this aspect of 
avian behavior.
Methods: To investigate nest attentiveness behaviors and evaluate these technologies, we monitored 13 nests 
across two Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) breeding colonies with a paired video camera - temperature logger 
approach, while monitoring 63 additional nests with temperature loggers alone. Observations occurred from May to 
August of 2017 on Poplar (Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA) and Skimmer Islands (Isle of Wight Bay, Maryland, USA). 
We examined data respective to four times of day: Morning (civil dawn‒11:59), Peak (12:00‒16:00), Cooling (16:01‒civil 
dusk), and Night (civil dusk‒civil dawn).
Results: While successful nests had mostly short duration off-bouts and maintained consistent nest attentiveness 
throughout the day, failed nests had dramatic reductions in nest attentiveness during the Cooling and Night periods 
(p < 0.05) with one colony experiencing repeated nocturnal abandonment due to predation pressure from a Great 
Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). Incubation appeared to ameliorate ambient temperatures during Night, as nests were 
significantly warmer during Night when birds were on versus off the nest (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, off-bouts during the 
Peak period occurred during higher ambient temperatures, perhaps due to adults leaving the nest during the hottest 
periods to perform belly soaking. Unfortunately, temperature logger data alone had limited ability to predict nest 
attentiveness status during shorter bouts, with results highly dependent on time of day and bout duration. While our 
methods did not affect hatching success (p > 0.05), video-monitored nests did have significantly lower clutch sizes 
(p < 0.05).
Conclusions: The paired use of iButtons and video cameras enabled a detailed description of the incubation 
behavior of COTE. However, while promising for future research, the logistical and potential biological complications 
involved in the use of these methods suggest that careful planning is needed before these devices are utilized to 
ensure data is collected in a safe and successful manner.

Traits as green cover often predict the occurrence patterns of bird species in urban areas. Yet, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN) could also limit the presence and disrupt the behavior of birds. However, there is still a dearth of knowledge about the influence of urbanization through noise and light pollution on nocturnal bird species ecology. In this study, we assessed the role of green cover, noise, and light pollution on the occurrence and vocal activity of the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata) in the city of Xalapa (Mexico). We obtained soundscape recordings in 61 independent sites scattered across the city of Xalapa using autonomous recording units. We performed a semi-automated acoustic analysis of the recordings, corroborating all Mottled Owl vocalizations. We calculated two measures of anthropogenic noise at each study site: daily noise (during 24 h) and masking noise (mean noise amplitude at night per site that could mask the owl’s vocalizations). We further performed generalized linear models to relate green cover, ALAN, daily noise, and masking noise in relation to the owl’s occurrence (i.e., detected, undetected). We also ran linear models to assess relationships among the beginning and ending of vocal activity with ALAN, and with the anthropogenic and masking noise levels at the moment of which vocalizations were emitted. Finally, we explored variations of the vocal activity of the Mottled Owl measured as vocalization rate across time. The presence of Mottled Owls increased with the size of green cover and decreased with increases in both artificial light at night and noise levels. At the temporal scale, green cover was positively related with the ending of the owl’s vocal activity, while daily noise and ALAN levels were not related to the timing and vocal output (i.e., number of vocalizations). Furthermore, the Mottled Owl showed a marked peak of vocal activity before dawn than after dusk. Although anthropogenic noise levels varied significantly across the assessed time, we did not find an association between high vocal output during time periods with lower noise levels. Spatially, green cover area was positively related with the presence of the Mottled Owl in Xalapa, while high noise and light pollution were related to its absence. At a temporal scale, daily noise and ALAN levels were not related with the timing and vocal output. This suggests that instead of environmental factors, behavioral contexts such as territoriality and mate interactions could drive the vocal activity of the Mottled Owl. Further studies need to incorporate a wider seasonal scale in order to explore the variation of different vocalizations of this species in relation to environmental and biological factors.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00197-7,avianres.biomedcentral.com,barn-owl,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.56438260573662,"['ciccaba virgata', 'mottled owl']",728

Avian exposure patterns appear driven by elevated atmospheric Hg deposition and increased methylmercury bioavailability within high elevation habitats as compared with low elevation forests.

This area has a large diversity of habitats, including tropical deciduous forests, which house a large number of endemic species. Here, we assess phylogeographic pattern, genetic and morphometric variation in the Cinnamon Hummingbird complex Amazilia rutila, which prefers habitats in this region. This resident species is distributed along the Pacific coast from Sinaloa—including the Tres Marías Islands in Mexico to Costa Rica, and from the coastal plain of the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico south to Belize. We obtained genetic data from 85 samples of A. rutila, using 4 different molecular markers (mtDNA: ND2, COI; nDNA: ODC, MUSK) on which we performed analyses of population structure (median-joining network, STRUCTURE, FST, AMOVA), Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, and divergence time estimates. In order to evaluate the historic suitability of environmental conditions, we constructed projection models using past scenarios (Pleistocene periods), and conducted Bayesian Skyline Plots (BSP) to visualize changes in population sizes over time. To analyze morphometric variation, we took measurements of 5 morphological traits from 210 study skins. We tested for differences between sexes, differences among geographic groups (defined based on genetic results), and used PCA to examine the variation in multivariate space. Using mtDNA, we recovered four main geographic groups: the Pacific coast, the Tres Marías Islands, the Chiapas region, and the Yucatán Peninsula together with Central America. These same groups were recovered by the phylogenetic results based on the multilocus dataset. Demography based on BSP results showed constant population size over time throughout the A. rutila complex and within each geographic group. Ecological niche model projections onto past scenarios revealed no drastic changes in suitable conditions, but revealed some possible refuges. Morphometric results showed minor sexual dimorphism in this species and statistically significant differences between geographic groups. The Tres Marías Islands population was the most differentiated, having larger body size than the remaining groups. The best supported evolutionary hypothesis of diversification within this group corresponds to geographic isolation (limited gene flow), differences in current environmental conditions, and historical habitat fragmentation promoted by past events (Pleistocene refugia). Four well-defined clades comprise the A. rutila complex, and we assess the importance of a taxonomic reevaluation. Our data suggest that both of A. r. graysoni (Tres Marías Islands) and A. r. rutila (Pacific coast) should be considered full species.

The data were obtained in a 2019 expedition during a survey of the southern part of the Great Kuril ridge. The research was conducted in the vicinity of Novokurilskaya Bay in the northeast of Urup Island and in the vicinity of Shchukin Bay on the Van der Lind Peninsula in the southwest of the island by route accounting on transects of unlimited width at altitudes of 0–200 m above sea level. The commonality of the taxonomic structure and species composition of the avifauna on Urup Island is high; in 2019, 90 bird species were recorded there: 59 on the northeast and 56 on the southwest of the island. The similarity coefficient of local avifauna of the surveyed points (n = 2), which was obtained by the Sørensen formula, is 68%. In all, 38% of species are widespread, 41% are local, and 21% are in isolated foci. Six species were recorded on Urup Island for the first time. The taxonomic structure of the Urup avifauna, formed by species of 12 orders, corresponds to the zonal and landscape features of island territories located near northeastern Eurasia. Passeriformes (39%), Charadriiformes (28%), and Anseriformes (10%), which are characteristic of the Boreal and Hypo-Arctic zones of the Palearctic, dominate. The zoogeographic originality of the local avifauna is due to the combination of elements of the Far Eastern–island, Pacifical, Siberian, and Chinese faunal complexes; Siberian–American and widespread species; and Japanese island endemics. The avifauna of Urup Island is formed in the system of general zonal-landscape and altitude-belt patterns combining ecological groups of marine, land, and mountain species. Mountain specifics of the avifauna are defined by the species (n = 9), which are ecologically closely related to land or water–near-water elements of the alpine landscape over the entire area of their range or a significant part of it. The bird population density of land habitats is 323‒609 sp/km2 (on average 466 sp/km2); on the coast and nearby sea area, it is 774–2050 sp/km2 (on average 1412 sp/km2). The similarity coefficients of bird populations are 20% in land-based habitats and 17% in the coastal-marine habitats. The population of forest and bush habitats is dominated by the Pacific swift, buff-bellied pipit, Arctic warbler, Eurasian nutcracker, and gray bunting. The population in the coast and the adjacent sea area is dominated by the harlequin duck, glaucous-winged gull, black-legged kittiwake, Pacific swift, buff-bellied pipit, and black-backed (White) wagtail.

Do urban green spaces with greater avian biodiversity promote more positive emotions in humans?,"Abstract
Urban green space can help mitigate the negative impacts of urban living and provide positive effects on citizens’ mood, health and
well-being. Questions remain, however, as to whether all types of green space are equally beneficial, and if not, what landscape
forms or key features optimise the desired benefits. For example, it has been cited that urban landscapes rich in wildlife (high
biodiversity) may promote more positive emotions and enhance well-being. This research utilised a mobile phone App, employed
to assess people’s emotions when they entered any one of 945 green spaces within the city of Sheffield, UK. Emotional responses
were correlated to key traits of the individual green spaces, including levels of biodiversity the participant perceived around them.
For a subsample of these green spaces, actual levels of biodiversity were assessed through avian and habitat surveys. Results
demonstrated strong correlations between levels of avian biodiversity within a green space and human emotional response to that
space. Respondents reported being happier in sites with greater avian biodiversity (p < 0.01, r = 0.78) and a greater variety of
habitats (p < 0.02, r = 0.72). Relationships were strengthened when emotions were linked to perceptions of overall biodiversity
(p < 0.001, r = 0.89). So, when participants thought the site was wildlife rich, they reported more positive emotions, even when
actual avian biodiversity levels were not necessarily enhanced. The data strengthens the arguments that nature enhances well-being
through positive affect, and that increased ‘engagement with nature’ may help support human health within urban environments.
The results have strong implications for city planning with respect to the design, management and use of city green spaces.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11252-020-00929-z.pdf,link.springer.com,derby,2022-04-12,0,1,1,1,1,-7.60979045222257,,776

The dynamics of this ectoparasite has been linked to several factors, including wild birds, fomites, farm workers, management of hen houses, and host traits. Along two consecutive years, we carried out systematic sampling at three laying hen farms located in Santa Fe province, Argentina, with the aim of identifying factors that may influence O. sylviarum prevalence and intensity. We found that the density of feathers around the hen vent area and the presence of Menoponidae lice were negatively associated with mite abundance. We also found that the density of hens in the cages was negatively associated with mite prevalence, suggesting a possible dilution effect, whereas prior reports found a positive association with hen density. In addition, summer was the season with minimum mite prevalences and intensities, contrary to previous studies in northern farms where warm weather appeared to prompt an increase in mite populations. Another factor associated with mite intensity was age, but this effect varied depending on the season, which hints that the association between hen’s age and mites is complex. Basic epidemiological knowledge on O. sylviarum in poultry farms from South America may aid in a more efficient and integrative approach to its control.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00436-022-07484-w.pdf,link.springer.com,avestruz,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.6106044935176,,29

Objectives Test the extent to which microclimate is an important determinant of the distribution of a widespread upland passerine, the meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, and whether microclimate becomes an increasingly important determinant of distribution towards the warm edge of the species’ range. Methods We used models of the occurrence of meadow pipits based on data from an extensive survey to identify macroclimate and topographic associations, the latter as proxies of microclimate. We assessed magnitude and direction of the effects of microclimate and whether the magnitude of microclimate effects increases as macroclimate suitability declines. Results The probability of meadow pipit occurrence is significantly correlated with macroclimate and microclimate. Microclimate accounts for about a third of the variation in occupancy probability and has a stronger effect than macroclimate at all three spatial scales considered. Elevation and topographical wetness index are positively correlated with meadow pipit occurrence, while insolation is negatively correlated. Elevation and macroclimate suitability show a positive interaction, while insolation and macroclimate suitability show a negative interaction.

We employed six habitat covariates, including terrain ruggedness and freshwater cover, and contrasted the influence of elevation with distance from coast, as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a proxy for vegetative productivity) with the normalized difference water index (NDWI; a proxy for vegetation water content). Our results most clearly show the importance of low elevation, large amounts of freshwater and high vegetative productivity for Arctic birds at relatively local scales (<1 km2). Although NDVI more consistently appeared in competitive models of abundance, NDWI was particularly important in predicting abundance for shorebirds, ducks, Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) and Lapland Longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus), demonstrating that it may be a more influential habitat covariate than NDVI for species that frequent habitats with wet vegetation. We also documented apparent shifts in habitat between early and late summer for geese, which were more strongly associated with freshwater later in the season, likely due to the presence of flightless juveniles and moulting adults at that time.

While practitioners strive for successful outcomes the failure rate of translocations continues to be high. We demonstrate how predictive modelling can contribute to more informed decision making and hence potentially improve the success rate of translocation programs. Two species, the Djoongari (Shark Bay mouse) Pseudomys fieldi and the golden bandicoot Isoodon auratus barrowensis, were introduced independently to Doole Island in the Exmouth Gulf of Western Australia. We used population viability analysis to critique the outcomes of these translocations and provide an example of how this tool can be incorporated with expert knowledge to predict likely outcomes of translocations. Djoongari did not establish on the island after seven translocations over nine years, while golden bandicoots established a population after just one release event. Retrospective population viability analysis (of data that was unavailable prior to the translocations) predicted and clarified the reasons behind the outcomes of both translocations. Golden bandicoots have considerably higher demographic plasticity than Djoongari, which were never likely to establish on the island. We conclude that the failure of the Djoongari translocation was due to interactions between sparse habitat, native predators and cyclonic storm surges, whereas golden bandicoots have demonstrated habitat flexibility and an ability to recover from multiple natural disasters.

To date, there is a limited understanding of the relationship between host egg rejection and cuckoo parasitism rate. By using egg experiments in the field, we compared egg rejection between two non-parasitized potential host species and two parasitized hosts of cuckoos in the same region. The White-bellied Redstart (Luscinia phoenicuroides), a host of the Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), rejected 66.6% of blue model eggs; the Elliot’s Laughingthrush (Trochalopteron elliotii), a host of the Large Hawk Cuckoo (Hierococcyx sparverioides), rejected 25% of blue model eggs and 46.1% of white model eggs; and the Chestnut Thrush (Turdus rubrocanus) and the Chinese Thrush (T. mupinensis), in which cuckoo parasitism has not been recorded, rejected 41.1 and 83.3% of blue model eggs, respectively. There were no significant differences in the egg rejection among them, although the Chinese Thrush showed the highest rate of egg rejection. This study indicates that the egg recognition ability of cuckoo hosts has no correlation with the actual parasitism rate of cuckoos. We suggest that the egg recognition ability of the two potential host species may have been retained from a parasitic history with the cuckoo, while the two common host species have developed their egg rejection abilities due to current parasitism pressure. In addition, our study highlights the importance of the multi-cuckoo parasite system for better understanding the selection pressure of parasitism on the evolution of host egg recognition abilities.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00220-x,avianres.biomedcentral.com,hawk-cuckoo,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.6478630930246,"['turdus rubrocanus', 'chestnut thrush', 'trochalopteron elliotii', 'redstart', 'cuculus canorus', 'chinese thrush', 'cuckoo', 'common cuckoo', 'hierococcyx sparverioides']",595

Azure-winged magpies have a cooperative breeding lifestyle in which related as well as unrelated individuals help out at the...,en,Azure-winged magpies’ decisions to share food are contingent on the presence or absence of food for the recipient,"Helping others is a key feature of human behavior. However, recent studies render this feature not uniquely human, and describe discoveries of prosocial behavior in non-human primates, other social mammals, and most recently in some bird species. Nevertheless, the cognitive underpinnings of this prosociality; i.e., whether animals take others’ need for help into account, often remain obscured. In this study, we take a first step in investigating prosociality in azure-winged magpies by presenting them with the opportunity to share highly desired food with their conspecifics i) in a situation in which these conspecifics had no such food, ii) in a situation in which they too had access to that highly desired food, and iii) in an open, base-line, situation where all had equal access to the same food and could move around freely. We find that azure-winged magpies regularly share high-value food items, preferably with, but not restricted to, members of the opposite sex. Most notably, we find that these birds, and specifically the females, seem to differentiate between whether others have food or do not have food, and subsequently cater to that lack. Begging calls by those without food seem to function as cues that elicit the food-sharing, but the response to that begging is condition-dependent. Moreover, analyses on a restricted dataset that excluded those events in which there was begging showed exactly the same patterns, raising the possibility that the azure-winged magpies might truly notice when others have access to fewer resources (even in the absence of vocal cues). This sharing behavior could indicate a high level of social awareness and prosociality that should be further investigated. Further studies are needed to establish the order of intentionality at play in this system, and whether azure-winged magpies might be able to attribute desire states to their conspecifics.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73256-0.pdf,nature.com,azurée,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.64800819000001,,567

We used geometric morphometrics to describe bill shape; measured bulk (δ15Nbulk) and (δ13Cbulk) values from feather as proxies of the birds’ foraging habitat and diet; and compared compound-specific stable isotopes analyses (CSIA) of nitrogen in amino acids (δ15NAA) in male–female pairs to estimate their trophic position. Sexes had significantly different, but overlapping feather δ15Nbulk and δ13Cbulk values, but δ15NAA indicated identical trophic positions and δ15Nbulk was not related to bill shape.

The goal of this study was to analyse WBH foraging microhabitat selection, foraging behaviour, and prey preferences in two river basins (Punatsangchhu and Mangdechhu) in Bhutan which are likely home to one of the largest remaining populations of WBH. We also explored the relationship between the relative abundance of the WBH and prey biomass catch per unit effort within four foraging river microhabitats (pool, pond, riffle and run). Prey species were sampled in 13 different 100-m thalweg lengths of the rivers using cast nets and electrofishing gear. Riffles and pools were the most commonly used microhabitats; relative abundance was the highest in riffles. The relative abundance of WBH and prey biomass catch per unit effort (CPUE) also showed a weak but significant positive correlation (rs = 0.22). The highest biomass CPUE was observed in riffles while the lowest was found in the ponds. From the 97 prey items caught by the WBH, 95% of the prey were fish. The WBH mainly exploited three genera of fish (Garra, Salmo, and Schizothorax) of which Schizothorax (64%) was the most frequently consumed. This study provides evidence in support of further protection of critical riverine habitat and fish resources for this heron. Regular monitoring of sand and gravel mining, curbing illegal fishing, habitat restoration/mitigation, and developing sustainable alternatives for local people should be urgently implemented by the government and other relevant agencies.

Alternatively, sexing can be based upon morphometric analysis, which remains invaluable in remote field conditions such as Polar regions. Nevertheless, discriminatory power may be affected by methodological issues hampering comparison between/within studies, e.g. considering alternative analytical techniques or measurements taken by different researchers. We investigated the sexing potential of bill length, bill depth and body mass in adult Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex. We performed discriminant analysis on a large dataset of measurements (237 males; 264 females) taken from penguins marked between 1994 and 2001, at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica). In a second step, we accounted for measurements collected by different researchers through permuted discriminant analysis. We found moderate support for sex discrimination through bill measurements (77%). Considering body mass did not improve classification power substantially (78.2%), possibly because of confounding inter/intra-annual oscillations in body condition. Discriminant rate decreased when controlling the researcher effect (72.7% and 71.4%, respectively). Results were also confirmed by logistic (mixed) models. Simulations showed that reduction in sample size markedly increased uncertainty in classification power. Differences with previous studies achieving a slightly greater classification power for sexing Adélie penguins through morphometrics could be related to (i) our higher sample size and/or (ii) geographical, population-specific differences, e.g. lower degree of sexual dimorphism.

Recent genomic analyses of kiwi suggest that several cryptic and as yet undescribed lineages occur in the South Island, most notably within a taxon that has until now been called Apteryx australis australis, the South Island Brown Kiwi or Tokoeka. In order for these lineages to be formally described and treated as separate conservation units it is first necessary to determine from which lineage of Tokoeka the holotype was collected. To determine this, we generated a near complete mitochondrial genome and nuclear SNP dataset for the holotype and compared these with living kiwi populations. Our results definitively assign the holotype to the Stewart Island population of brown kiwi which until now was recognized as a distinct subspecies Apteryx australis lawyri (Rothschild, 1893). This leads us to synonymize Apteryx lawryi Rothschild, 1893 within Apteryx australis Shaw, 1813. As the holotype was collected by sealers in the early 19th century, the result also provides a novel insight into the activities of early sealers in New Zealand.

David Bishop, from OBC Bulletin 29, May 1999. Bhutan, often referred to as 'Shangri La', is surely a paradise on earth for those birders privileged enough to visit this tiny Himalayan kingdom. Encompassing an area of just 47,000 km2 and tucked away in the moist, floristically rich eastern Himalayas, Bhutan has recently cracked its door ajar, permitting birders to sample some of its truly sumptuous avian delights. David Bishop reports. I first explored Bhutan in 1994, and since then I have returned each spring, to lead bird tours for Victor Emanuel Nature Tours. The sheer unadulterated beauty and pristine nature of this country, with seemingly endless forests, draws one ever onward. The fascinating and relatively unaffected cultures and, perhaps above all, an opportunity to experience a small window into what the majority of the Himalayas must once have looked and sounded like, are just some of the factors that make Bhutan such a very special place. Despite Bhutan's small size, over 600 species have been recorded from the Kingdom, including nearly 70 which have been added during the last ten years. And what fun it has been to be one of the few to visit the country and document some of these additions. Several other species may eventually be found, including such sought-after 'myths' as Wedge-billed Wren Babbler Sphenocichla humei and Rufous-bellied Shortwing Brachypteryx hyperythra. Of Bhutan's 614 species, 16 are listed as Threatened and 31 Near-threatened by Collar et al. (1) and Bhutan is one of the best places to see some of them. Although the country does not host any endemic species of its own, it lies within the Eastern Himalayas Endemic Bird Area (as classified by BirdLife International) and harbours at least 12 'Restricted Range' species. Bhutan may be small, but within its borders is an extraordinary range of habitats: from some of the Himalaya's most extensive and least disturbed subtropical forests, upwards through truly exquisite warm and, at higher elevations, cool broadleaved forests to towering evergreen forests of fir, hemlock and spruce. The Eastern Himalayas are notably moister and much warmer than areas further to the west and, as a consequence, the tree-line occurs at a much higher elevation; c. 4,250 m vs c. 3,330 m. Above the tree-line are extensive alpine pastures which from late spring to early autumn present one of the great botanical spectacles on our planet. The entire country is bisected by a well-maintained paved road, permitting relatively easy access to habitats from 150 to 3,750 m. This extraordinary feat of engineering extends northwards from Phuntsholing in the south-west, on the border with India's Jalpaiguri district, to Paro and Thimphu. There the road turns eastwards at a mid-point in the country over a series of high passes via the fortified town of Tongsa, with its spectacular hanging Dzong, to the relatively highly populated town of Tashigang. The route continues south past the university town of Sherubtse and descends the Himalayas in a series of breathtakingly dizzy slopes to the border town of Somdrup Jonkhar and, once again, the plain of the Brahmaputra valley. One of the features of Bhutan is that birding, especially in mid to late spring (late March to mid-May), is good virtually anywhere below 3,030 m. Unlike many parts of Asia one is not obliged to seek out a park or reserve or remnant patch of 'good-looking' habitat, since any stop, even in the midst of farmland, can produce exciting birds. Notwithstanding, the mixed broadleaved forests are much richer, and therefore more exciting, than the rather slow-going monotypic stands of blue pine and, particularly, chir pine. Clearly the former is the habitat upon which to focus one's efforts.",,orientalbirdclub.org,sapphire,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.68459995986677,"['brachypteryx hyperythra', 'wren', 'sphenocichla humei']",1000

To investigate fish diversity and habitat status of Saraiyaman, exploratory surveys were conducted from April 2017 to March 2021. The analysis resulted in distribution of 58 fish species belonging to 7 orders, 20 families and 40 genera. Cypriniformes was found as the most dominant order. Out of 58 species, 7 were evaluated under Near Threatened (NT) category.

The loss of Saraiyaman’s connection from River Gandak, increasing encroachment by cropland and climate change have resulted in water level reduction, water area shrinkage, eutrophication, infestation of aquatic weeds, degradation in habitat condition for fish community, decline in fish population, especially vulnerable catfish Wallago attu, and lack of quality fish brooders. Hence, under influence of multiple stressors, Saraiyaman is leading towards marsh and land afterwards.

Single-species recovery thus becomes a focus (often with socio-political implications), whereas a more economical approach would be the transition to multi-targeted management (= MTM). This challenge is best represented in Midwestern North America where biodiversity has been impacted by 300+ years of chronic anthropogenic disturbance such that native tall-grass prairie is now supplanted by an agroecosystem. Here, we develop an MTM with a population genetic metric to collaboratively manage three Illinois upland gamebirds: common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus; pheasant), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus; quail), and threatened-endangered (T&E) greater prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus; prairie chicken). We first genotyped our study pheasant at 19 microsatellite DNA loci and identified three captive breeding stocks (N = 143; IL Department of Natural Resources) as being significantly bottlenecked, with relatedness >1st-cousin (μR = 0.158). ‘Wild’ (non-stocked) pheasant [N = 543; 14 Pheasant-Habitat-Areas (PHAs)] were also bottlenecked, significantly interrelated (μR = 0.150) and differentiated (μFST = 0.047), yet distinct from propagation stock. PHAs that encompassed significantly with larger areas also reflected greater effective population sizes (μNE = 43; P<0.007). We juxtaposed these data against previously published results for prairie chicken and quail, and found population genetic structure driven by drift, habitat/climate impacts, and gender-biased selection via hunter-harvest. Each species (hunter-harvested or T&E) is independently managed, yet their composite population genetic baseline provides the quantitative criteria needed for an upland game bird MTM. Its implementation would require agricultural plots to be rehabilitated/reclaimed using a land-sharing/sparing portfolio that differs markedly from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), where sequestered land decreases as agricultural prices escalate. Cost-savings for an MTM would accrue by synchronizing single-species management with a dwindling hunter-harvest program, and by eliminating propagation/stocking programs.

Introduction
A new species of black-and-white wagtail has recently been described from the lower Mekong catchment of north-east Cambodia, southern Laos and, marginally, north-east Thailand.(1) It has been named Mekong Wagtail Motacilla samveasnae, its scientific binomial honouring the late Sam Veasna (pronounced 'Sam Veeshna'), one of Cambodia's leading ornithologists and conservationists, who tragically died of malaria in December 1999.(2) It is the only wagtail that breeds in the lower Mekong catchment, to which on current knowledge it is restricted. Morphologically, Mekong Wagtail most closely resembles the widely disjunct African Pied Wagtail M. aguimp, though it differs in several minor respects, particularly wing pattern, and vocally it is highly distinct.(1) Moreover, mitochondrial DNA comparisons show that divergence between Mekong Wagtail and African Pied Wagtail is greater than between any of the other black-and-white wagtail taxa, and it also exhibits clear differences in moult strategy and habitat choice (1). It is highly distinctive, being the only black-and-white wagtail in South-East Asia exhibiting the adult/first-adult plumage character combination of a black forehead, lores and ear coverts, striking white supercilia, a white throat and white neck patch.(1,3) Mekong Wagtail © Pete Davidson Habitat specificity and parallels with other species
Mekong Wagtail is restricted to specific habitats of wide lowland river channels. Breeding birds are strongly associated with fast-flowing braided sections that bisect a distinctive mosaic of rocks, bushes adapted to prolonged seasonal submersion (predominantly Homonoia riparia), and some unconsolidated sediment (sandbars and gravel shoals)(1). These become inundated as river levels rise during the May/June-October/November rainy season. The few observations made to date during the high-flow season, all of which have been along stretches known to be used by breeding birds, indicate that the species concentrates along earthen banks and associated overhanging vegetation, and also restricted patches of exposed sand and silt, where they occur in pairs (some of which seem strongly territorial) and small flocks/feeding aggregations (of up to 12 individuals). It is unclear whether some birds make seasonal movements in response to rising water levels, but this is highly plausible given that some sections of channel mosaic and exposed riverbank used by breeding birds are completely submerged at the height of the high-flow season. No other Eurasian wagtail exhibits such high habitat specificity. Although Grey Wagtail M. cinerea and Japanese Wagtail M. grandis are regarded as river/stream specialists, their habitat use is much broader than that of Mekong Wagtail.(3,4) White-browed Wagtail M. maderaspatensis and, in some areas, White Wagtails of the forms M. alba personata, M. alba alboides and M. alba leucopsis are mainly found at or near water, including along rivers, but none of them is nearly so specialised.(3,5,6) Non-breeding White Wagtails of the form M. alba leucopsis abound in southern Indochina during the palearctic winter, particularly along sandbars in rivers and earthen riverbanks, the very habitats generally shunned in the low-flow (breeding) season by Mekong Wagtails; conversely, in channel mosaic, leucopsis White Wagtail is less common, occurring mainly in sections with much sand. African Pied Wagtail uses a much wider variety of habitats,(1,7) including structurally similar channel mosaic habitat, at least in Gabon (JWD unpublished data).",,orientalbirdclub.org,wagtail,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.73374167601518,"['grey wagtail', 'japanese wagtail', 'white wagtail', 'african pied wagtail', 'mekong wagtail', 'motacilla samveasnae']",1000

However, plumage conceals most skin in birds, and as a result the presence, evolution and function of skin colour remains unexplored. Here we show, using a database of 2259 species encompassing &gt;99% of bird genera, that melanin-rich, black skin is found in a small but sizeable percentage (~5%) of birds, and that it evolved over 100 times. The spatial distribution of black skin follows Gloger’s rule, which states that pigmentation of endothermic animals increases towards the equator. Furthermore, most black-skinned birds inhabit high irradiation regions, and tend to be bald and/or have white feathers. Thus, taken together, our results suggest that melanin-rich, black skin helps to protect birds against ultraviolet irradiation. More generally, our results illustrate that feathered skin colour varies taxonomically, ontogenetically and temporally, providing an additional dimension for avian colour research. In contrast to bird plumage, little is known about the evolution of bird skin color.

Parasite and host nestlings may themselves be parasitized by botfly larvae (Philornis: Muscidae), which burrow under the nestlings’ skin and can seriously affect growth and survival. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that adult baywings (Agelaioides badius), the primary host of the specialist brood parasitic screaming cowbird (Molothrus rufoaxillaris), regularly remove botfly larvae from their own and parasitic nestlings by pulling them out of the nestlings’ skin. This is the only bird species known to remove botfly larvae. By combining nestling cross-fostering with video recording of baywing nests, we show that due to prompt removal, infection with botfly larvae had negligible effects on nestling growth and survival despite high prevalence. Our results provide the first direct observations for larva removal behavior in botfly hosts. Screaming cowbirds may benefit from using baywings as its main host, as larva removal by adult baywings reduces the costs of botfly parasitism. Significance statement Infection by botfly larvae of the genus Philornis (Muscidae) causes nestling mortality in many Neotropical birds.

Behavioural observations of aggression by swans and other waterbirds in winters 2018/2019 and 2019/2020, were carried out via live-streaming webcams at two wintering sites in the UK. All occurrence sampling was used to identify all aggressive interactions between conspecific or heterospecifics individuals, whilst focal observations were used to record the total time spent by swans on aggressive interactions with other swans. Binomial tests were then used to assess whether the proportion of intraspecific aggressive interactions of each species differed from 0.5 (which would indicate equal numbers of intraspecific and interspecific interactions). Zero-inflated generalized linear mixed effects models (ZIGLMMs) were used to assess between-individual variation in the total time spent by swans on aggressive interactions with other swans. All three swan species were most frequently aggressive towards, and received most aggression from, their conspecifics. Our 10-min focal observations showed that Whooper (Cygnus cygnus) and Bewick’s Swans (C. columbianus bewickii) spent 13.8 ± 4.7 s (means ± 95% CI) and 1.4 ± 0.3 s, respectively, on aggression with other swans. These durations were equivalent to 2.3% and 0.2% of the Whooper and Bewick’s Swan time-activity budgets, respectively. Model selection indicated that the time spent in aggressive interactions with other swans was best-explained by the number of other swans present for Whooper Swans, and an interactive effect of time of day and winter of observation for Bewick’s Swans. However, the relationship between swan numbers and Whooper Swan aggression times was not strong (R2 = 19.3%).

Although ...",en,Background matching and disruptive coloration as habitat-specific strategies for camouflage,"Camouflage is a key defence across taxa and frequently critical to survival. A common strategy is background matching, resembling the colour and pattern of the environment. This approach, however, may be ineffective in complex habitats where matching one patch may lead to increased visibility in other patches. In contrast, disruptive coloration, which disguises body outlines, may be effective against complex backgrounds. These ideas have rarely been tested and previous work focuses on artificial systems. Here, we test the camouflage strategies of the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) in two habitats, being a species that is highly variable, capable of plastic changes in appearance, and lives in multiple environments. Using predator (bird and fish) vision modelling and image analysis, we quantified background matching and disruption in crabs from rock pools and mudflats, predicting that disruption would dominate in visually complex rock pools but background matching in more uniform mudflats. As expected, rock pool individuals had significantly higher edge disruption than mudflat crabs, whereas mudflat crabs more closely matched the substrate than rock pool crabs for colour, luminance, and pattern. Our study demonstrates facultative expression of camouflage strategies dependent on the visual environment, with implications for the evolution and interrelatedness of defensive strategies.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44349-2.pdf,nature.com,violette,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.73929025322257,,1062

We investigated the genetic mating system of the Magellanic Penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus, a species that is reported to be monogamous, with little or no evidence of extra-pair paternity, high partner faithfulness over the years and intense biparental care. Thus, we proposed that if EPP does occur, the rate will be low and could be related to increased genetic diversity among offspring or the body condition of parents. As a consequence, we hypothesize that offspring from EPP will exhibit faster growth than non-EPP offspring, thus increasing their survival probability. In contrast to expectations, EPP was detected in 31% of the offspring and 48% of the nests had at least one extra-pair young. In addition, 6% of chicks were not the offspring of the putative mother or either member of the social pair, indicating evidence of IBP. However, we did not find a difference in genetic diversity between nests with or without EPP, nor did we find differences in parent body condition. Offspring from EPP showed slightly faster growth than non-EPP offspring, although this difference was not statistically significant. These results reveal a high rate of EPP and a low rate of IBP, both of which were previously unknown for this species.

Birds living in cold habitats, particularly those with nests exposed to incident solar radiation, have darker eggs. We show evidence that darker eggs heat more rapidly than lighter ones when exposed to solar radiation. This evidence suggests that egg pigmentation could play an important role in thermoregulation in cold climates, while a range of competing selective pressures further influence eggshell colours in warmer climates.

Identity and De-extinction,"I will entertain and reject three arguments which putatively establish that the individuals produced through de-extinction ought to be the same species as the extinct population. Forms of these arguments have appeared previously in restoration ecology. The first is the weakest, the conceptual argument, that de-extinction will not be de-extinction if it does not re-create an extinct species. This is misguided as de-extinction technology is not unified by its aim to re-create extinct species but in its use of the remnants of extinct populations as a resource. The second is the argument from authenticity; the populations produced by de-extinction technologies will be inauthentic if they are not of the extinct species and, therefore, will not be valuable. I argue authenticity is not required in conservation as the value of authenticity varies between people and cultures, and the novelty of de-extinct species will be equally desirable in many cases. The third argument is from retributive justice; we need the de-extinct population to have the same species identity as we owe a moral debt to the extinct population. I find the case for retributive justice unconvincing and argue that acting as if we have a duty to resurrect extinct species will result in a world with less species. Ultimately all the arguments that connect de-extinction technology to species identity fail, leaving us to consider a more complex calculus for the justification of de-extinction in conservation.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10806-020-09839-8.pdf,link.springer.com,huia,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.7803446984477,,516

View author ...",en,Bird embryos perceive vibratory cues of predation risk from clutch mates,"During development in fluctuating environments, phenotypes can be adjusted to the conditions that individuals will probably encounter later in life. As developing embryos have a limited capacity to fully capture environmental information, theory predicts that they should integrate relevant information from all reliable sources, including the social environment. In many oviparous species, embryos are able to perceive cues of predator presence in some circumstances, but whether this information is socially transmitted among clutch mates—promoting phenotypic adjustments in the whole clutch—is unknown. Here, using an experimental design for which we modified the exposure to some, but not all, embryos of the same clutch to cues of predator presence (that is, alarm calls), we show that exposed embryos of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and their unexposed clutch mates showed similar developmental changes that were absent in embryos from control clutches. Compared with the control broods, both embryos that were exposed to alarm calls and their unexposed clutch mates showed altered prenatal and postnatal behaviours, higher levels of DNA methylation and stress hormones, and reduced growth and numbers of mitochondria (which may be indicative of the capacity for energy production of cells). These results strongly suggest that gull embryos are able to acquire relevant environmental information from their siblings. Together, our results highlight the importance of socially acquired information during the prenatal stage as a non-genetic mechanism promoting developmental plasticity. Exposing the eggs of yellow-legged gulls to adult conspecific predator alarm calls, the authors show that this information can be socially transmitted to other embryos in the clutch, even when they are naive to these calls.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0929-8.pdf,nature.com,alberto,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.7825888899044,['larus michahellis'],1003

The song is similar to those of the other species within the Turtur genus and likely reflects the adaptation to long distance signalling in tropical habitats. There is no study assessing individual variation of the Tambourine Dove song or for the possibility of identity coding through song features. We obtained recordings of 578 songs from 41 males within a population inhabiting montane forest in Cameroon between 2008 and 2018. Additionally, we analysed also recordings from automatic recorders working for a longer time during the year. Songs were analysed to get basic information about within- and between-individual spectro-temporal variation. Potential of identity coding and discriminant analyses were used to investigate if and how these songs may convey information about male identity. The song of the Tambourine Dove is a very simple series of short, unmodulated whistles with low frequency and a narrow bandwidth. Measurements of single song features indicated either none or a weak potential for identity coding. The overall variation in song frequency characteristics was very low. However, the number of notes forming a song (and consequently the duration) had a similar variability both within- and between individuals. When using multiple song measurements discrimination analysis revealed a high potential for identity coding although it seems that the temporal pattern of the beginning of a song carries the most information about sender identity. The production of initial notes within a song has very precise, individually specific timing allowing for up to 96.7% correct recognitions of songs. Comparison of recordings from the same points but separated in time by over a month indicates that song parameters are individually stable over longer period. Despite having highly stereotyped and simple songs, Tambourine Dove males produce individually specific signals which have a great potential for recognition by rivals or mates. All Turtur doves have similar yet unique songs that are different to the songs of other pigeon species. This genus seems to be a perfect model for studying the trade-off between coding for species identity and individual identity in a non-learning bird species.

Spring is the season during which birds have to physiologically prepare for the subsequent breeding period, and unusual spring temperature rising probably becomes a heat stress to the birds which have adapted to the low spring temperature. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the physiological effect of spring warming on the temperate birds. Using the activities of blood anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx) and the concentrations of serum immunogloblins (IgA, IgY, IgM) as indicators, we compared the anti-oxidative and immune functions of Asian Short-toed Larks (Calandrella cheleensis) captured between 10 and 15 March, 2015 and housed under conditions of 21 °C and 16 °C. The SOD activities of birds in 21 °C group were significantly lower than those in 16 °C group on all the treatment days.

Edwards, from OBC Bulletin 27, June 1998. Introduction In February 1969 the first bombs fell from a US B-52 bomber over eastern Cambodia, and over the next four years huge quantities were dropped on the country, resulting in a civil war which continues to this day. The Khmer Rouge, a previously ineffective guerrilla movement, occupied Phnom Penh in April 1975 two weeks before Saigon fell to the communist Vietnamese. What followed was one of the most infamous social engineering experiments ever devised. Cities were forcibly evacuated, currency abolished, hospitals and schools closed, and anyone of intellectual standing was executed. Between two and three million people are believed to have died before the Vietnamese overthrew the regime in 1978. Despite recent defections, conflict continues between the Khmer Rouge and government forces. In Cambodia recent history dominates everything including nature conservation. The flooded bomb craters around the airport are one of the first things you notice upon arrival, but the legacy of the war is all around, not least in the 40 million landmines estimated to have been laid. As such, physical access to the countryside is extremely limited and continuing hostilities place limits on conservation activities. Moreover, the mass execution of intellectuals has led to a shortage of educated people to implement government policies and time is thus needed to establish the base of experience that most other countries take for granted. Sarus Crane © Patrick Bierens Biodiversity
Cambodia covers an area of 181,035 square km of continental South-East Asia bordered by Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. It has a short coastline of only 435 km. The Mekong River and the Tonlé Sap dominate the country's hydrology and there are two groups of mountains those in the east comprising the western slope of the Annamite Chain while those in the south-west are the isolated highlands of the Elephant and Cardomom Mountains. From studies carried out before the war it appears that Cambodia may support about 212 species of mammal, 720 bird species, 240 reptiles species and over 2,300 species of vascular plants (1,2). The country is regionally immensely important for its biodiversity because, unlike its neighbours, natural habitats remain relatively abundant, particularly lowland forests and wetlands which have been reduced or greatly modified elsewhere. Forests
Cambodia contains the largest extent of natural forest in continental South-East Asia (3). These support an abundance of wildlife featuring a wide range of mammals including cats, bears, primates, elephant, rhinoceroses, native cattle and deer. The fauna includes a number of species that have greatly declined or become extinct in neighbouring countries and, given the lack of comprehensive surveys, may even include rare species new to the country, e.g. douc langur, Pygathrix nemaeus, or even to science, e.g. the 'khting sipu' (snake-eating deer), horns of which have been discovered in north-east Cambodia.",,orientalbirdclub.org,greenshank,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.80090884246132,['sarus crane'],1000

So far, studies of home-range overlap typically make use of comparisons between pairs of individuals, populations or species, and return a matrix of pairwise overlaps (e.g., percent overlaps). However, when the number of individuals, populations or species to be compared is elevated, an overlarge overlap matrix is difficult to interpret from an ecological viewpoint. We propose here a new, conceptually simple and computationally efficient index (general overlap index; GOI) for the ready computation within GIS of home range overlap of an arbitrarily large number (i.e., n ≥ 2) of individuals, populations or species. Whatever the number of home ranges to be compared, GOI always returns a single score between 0 and 100. As a case study, we applied our index to 24,074 GPS points of 10 Lesser Kestrels (Falco naumanni) in order to estimate within-colony and between-colony overlaps in two neighboring colonies in Southern Italy. Within-colony overlap was elevated for both colonies (96.41% at Cassano delle Murge, n = 5 individuals; 81.38% at Santeramo in Colle, n = 5 individuals), while between-colony overlap was low (19.12%; n = 2 colonies) and, after a randomization procedure, more spatially-segregated than expected by chance. Modern biotelemetry offers huge amounts of data describing the space use of animal species. The use of intuitive and straightforward indices, like GOI, can be useful to promptly extract ecological information from such an amount of data (e.g. detecting change in space use over successive years, evaluating the reliability of various home-range estimators).",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00240-7,avianres.biomedcentral.com,kestrel,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.80096110367631,['falco naumanni'],470

The site is known for the excellent preservation of its brush huts and botanical remains. This study examines the behavior of its past inhabitants through analysis of the entire faunal assemblage found on the three successive floors of Brush Hut 1. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to test differing models of prey choice and assess whether the observed resource diversification is the result of resource depression (explained by Optimal Foraging Theory) or resource abundance (explained by Niche Construction Theory). We focused on a quantitative, qualitative and spatial investigation of the more than 20,000 faunal remains, combining traditional zooarchaeological methods with microwear analysis of teeth and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) of burnt bones. Identification of faunal remains to the most detailed level possible, combined with analysis of skeletal element frequencies allowed reconstruction of a profile of the desired prey, highlighting the importance of small, expedient prey compared to larger game (ungulates). FTIR was used to identify degrees of burning and to develop a key to identifying burnt bones from water-logged environments. Availability of multiple food sources within a rich habitat may have driven exploitation of those varied local resources, rather than targeting energetically-rich large prey. The choice of a littoral habitat that could be intensively exploited is an example of niche selection. Comparison with contemporaneous and later sites contributes to the ongoing discussion about Early Epipaleolithic prey choice, and the impact, if any, of the LGM in the Jordan Valley.

We present a novel application of palynological analyses to assess habitat use of the endangered Black-polled Yellowthroat
(Geothlypis speciosa) and the sympatric Common Yellowthroat (G. trichas) in Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico. Since field monitoring of songbirds
can be difficult due to complex habitat requirements, behavioral, or logistical issues, our results provide an important methodological
alternative for habitat assessment and conservation monitoring of species difficult to study with traditional methods. We found
significant differences between pollen rain in water samples and pollen loads in feathers. Pollen loads were comparable between bird
species during both rainy and dry seasons. Contrary to previous assumptions, Black-polled Yellowthroats showed pollen loads associated
with terrestrial habitats, particularly during the dry season. Our results on equitability resource-use, showed marked differences between
seasons, being more homogeneous in the dry season than in the rainy season. In addition, equitability values of pollen loads were
similar between sexes in Common Yellowthroat but significantly higher in males as compared to females' Black-polled Yellowthroats,
suggesting some degree of resource partitioning. GLM's identified a significantly negative relationship between anemophilous and
entomophilous pollination syndromes in both species and the pollen rain recorded during dry and rainy seasons, as well as a significant

Using data from four habituated groups of western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in Central Africa, we investigated the possible influence of ecological (food type and quantity) and social factors (presence, arrival and departure of specific group members) on food call production. Western gorillas emitted food calls mainly in foraging contexts. The emission probability increased with food types of high quality (in relation to the season) and, particularly, with abundant food patches. Food calls elicited the arrival of group members at the feeding tree. Adult females, the most frequent signallers, mostly emitted food calls when the silverback and all offspring were absent at the feeding tree, when compared to the absence of other group members. From the receiver perspective, the probability that the silverback and all offspring arrived at the feeding tree increased when adult females emitted food calls. When calling, adult females likely benefit by increasing both nutritional intake and protection of their own offspring (by increasing spatial proximity with the silverback). Moreover, food calls emitted in the second part of the duration of tree visits had the strongest effect on the prolongation of the feeding session. Our results suggest that the adaptive reasons of food calls in one-male harem species may be increasing group cohesion/coordination and facilitating offspring survival. Significance statement The adaptive reasons for the widespread presence of food calls in many animal species aremultiple and not mutually exclusive. We showed that western gorilla emitted food calls mainly in foraging contexts; they attract other group members and deliver information on the presence of abundant resources of high quality. Food calls emitted in the second part of the tree visit seem to prolong the feeding session. Adult females, the most frequent signallers, emitted food calls more often when their offspring and the silverback are absent. These results suggest that, in species with rather stable society (such as one-male harem), this behaviour may serve to increase cohesion/coordination and to facilitate offspring survival. This study is a first step for increasing our understanding on the presence of functionally referential calls in wild western gorillas.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03027-y.pdf,link.springer.com,aurore,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-7.82575419797946,,310

This study tested whether the learning and science commitment of 8- to 10-year old pupils was affected by extracurricular learning opportunities involving repeated interactions with free-living northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita; an endangered bird species) and professional researchers. To examine the project’s efficacy, pupils’ learning progress was monitored by repeated measures of knowledge (i) about northern bald ibises in specific, and (ii) of bird diversity in general. In addition, the children’s attitudes toward science were monitored and their dynamic mental models of northern bald ibis’ morphology and size were assessed from drawings. A total of 55 pupils from two schools were tested for eight months (before, during and after the experience). Control groups went through regular (curricular) science lessons with similar content and time investment. The extracurricular experience produced a clear learning progress with large effect sizes, which was particularly evident on a long timescale. In addition to subject matter knowledge, the project group pupils could name more bird species and expressed their views about the importance of scientific research for society in a higher proportion than control groups. Differences between schools suggest that project participation also changed the teacher’s own interest in northern bald ibises, which affected learning in the control group taught by the same teacher. Beyond the pupils’ language and reading skills, learning progress was also visible by scoring ibis-typical features in drawings; their mental models of relative size were not changed due to project participation, however. The results are discussed in reference to inducing and maintaining pupils’ attitude and interest in a topic.

A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 82 farmers in 28 villages. The data were analysed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, independent-sample t test and the multiple correspondence analysis with SPSS and XLSTAT. The results showed that guinea fowl production was mainly practised by men (91.5%) who did not have training in guinea fowl production (68.4%). In traditional poultry farming, the most popular management method was the semi-intensive system (86.2%). Guinea fowl, which was raised primarily for sale (100%), was the main bird species with 68.2 ± 92.5 birds per farmer. All respondents provided a dietary supplement to guinea fowl with a feeding management that varied according to the birds’ developmental stage. Wing drooping (89.3%), diarrhoea (67.4%) and drowsiness (64.7%) were the main clinical symptoms of diseases observed. The majority of respondents (68.2%) used both conventional veterinary products and ethno-veterinary plant products as drugs in order to control guinea fowl diseases. Guinea fowl started laying at 8.4 ± 1.6 months and had 128.5 ± 51.2 eggs per year. The indigenous hen that hatched eggs naturally had 43.6 ± 17.1 hatching eggs per year with a hatchability of 85.0%.

While we are engaged in issuing “preliminary reports,” they have already arranged and classified their collections, and are beginning to publish their discoveries. The specimens of birds obtained by Dr. Kidder, surgeon and naturalist attached to the astronomical party at Kerguelen's Land, or Desolation Island, have been placed for determination in the hands of Dr. E. Cones —one of the most competent zoologists in the United States—and the result has been the very interesting memoir now before us. We knew already that Kerguelen's Land was not an inviting place of residence for the more highly organised animals, and that few birds were to be found there. We know now what those few are, and have full particulars about most of them, their lives, and habits. According to Dr. Coues' determination, Dr. Kidder's collection contains examples of twenty-one species of this class, belonging to six families, namely, eleven Petrels, four Penguins, three Gulls, a Cormorant, a Duck, and a Sheath-bill. Of these, the two last-named are “the only partial vegetable feeders observed, all the other birds feeding exclusively on flesh, fish, or marine invertebrates.” Of the Chionis, or Sheath-bills, a singular abnormal form related to the Plovers, of which there are (or were lately) living specimens in the Zoological Society's Gardens, Dr. Kidder might well have sung, in the words of the old song, “their tameness is shocking to me.” “They would scarcely get out of my way,” says the Doctor, “and seemed greatly interested in my movements. When I sat on a stone, keeping perfectly still, the whole party, twelve in all, came up to examine the intruder. They walked all around me, coming almost within reach; others flying up from more distant rocks to join them, and finally stopped, almost in a semi-circle, for a good stare. After watching the birds for a time, I shot four specimens, not without compunction, on account of killing such trustful acquaintances. When I walked off to get a sufficient distance away for a shot, the whole troop started to follow me, making little runs and stopping, as if filled with curiosity. I shot all four without moving from the spot, reloading for each, the birds not all flying out of range even after the gun had been fired. On subsequent occasions, various members of the party captured specimens by hand; all that was necessary to attract them within reach being to remain perfectly still. After one had been caught it served as a lure for others. When taken home alive they still showed no fear, but when let loose in the house took food readily.”",,nature.com,chionis,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.8426452002689455,['cormorant'],1000

However, there is no study assessing the vocal differences among these four subspecies. We obtained 76 sound recordings of the G. brodiei species complex comprising all four subspecies. We conducted bioacoustic examinations using principal component analysis and the Isler criterion to quantitatively test species boundaries within the G. brodiei complex. In addition, we compared plumage colouration among 13 specimens of the G. brodiei complex deposited at the Natural History Museum at Tring, UK and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore to ascertain the presence of plumage differences across taxa. We found the Bornean and Sumatran populations vocally similar to each other, but distinctly different from the mainland and Taiwan populations. The vocal pattern seems to corroborate plumage distinctions in the colouration of neck collars: the Bornean and Sumatran taxa share a white neck collar, whereas the continental and Taiwan taxa share a rufous neck collar. We propose the taxonomic elevation of the Sumatran and Bornean populations to species level as Sunda Owlet G. sylvaticum, with one subspecies on Sumatra (G. s. sylvaticum) and Borneo (G. s. borneense) each.

Flocks of brown and black New Guinean birds: a bicoloured mixed-species foraging association. Emu 87, 201–211. A type of itinerant mixed-species foraging association of New Guinean birds, the brown and black flock, is distinctive in that member species converge on two alternative colours rather than on one, and in that the flock retains its character through many geographic and altitudinal changes of species composition. To complement Bell's intensive study of a single lowland flock, I survey the flocks throughout their geographic and altitudinal range. The flocks are composed of 35 species belonging to 7 families and are led hierarchically: by the Rufous Babbler Pomatostomus isidorei if it is present, otherwise by the Rusty Pitohui Pitohui ferrugineus if it is present, otherwise by one of four other Pitohui species. The followers include either of two drongo species, 15 bird-of-paradise species, seven cuckoo-shrike species, and five other species. Flock-joining species are all medium to large forest passerines coloured predominantly brown or black. In nine species the male is black, the female brown. Most member species are endemic to the New Guinean region, eat both fruit and insects, and can forage from the understorey to lower canopy. Different flock members may derive different benefits from joining the flocks, including access to food flushed by other species, opportunities for kleptoparasitism, protection from predators, overwhelming of territorial defenders, and increased foraging efficiency. The possible benefits of convergence in colour include enhancing the confusion of predators, maintaining spacing of allospecific individuals, and promoting flock cohesion through economy of signal. I hypothesize that a flock forms when a noisy social species (‘leader’ species) provides a critical level of vocal and visual signals that attract other, ecologically and visually similar species (‘follower’ species).",,tandfonline.com,amalocichla,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.8600037853033085,"['emu', 'pomatostomus isidorei', 'pitohui ferrugineus', 'rusty pitohui', 'cuckoo', 'rufous babbler']",1000

Due to a complex history of European colonization in the Caribbean, natural history writings about inland aquatic diversity for the USVI began almost 250 years later than those from elsewhere. Those early writings were produced primarily by clergy and largely recorded indigenous knowledge from other islands. Proposed in the first natural history by West in 1793, and reinforced later by Ledru in 1810, an assumption emerged that Puerto Rico and USVI faunas were almost identical. This partially explains the paucity of work in almost all aquatic faunal groups but birds. We review the history of inland aquatic faunal observations and studies in the USVI, from pre-Columbian traditions to recent faunal assessments. We discuss the pivotal Scientific Survey of Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands and the importance of local and foreign naturalists and taxonomists for our understanding of aquatic biota. Since 1900, 155 articles included observations on USVI inland aquatic animals, without clear trends toward increased or decreased publication output since the 1960s. Taxonomic bias toward studies on insects and birds, and geographic bias toward vertebrate work from St. Croix, are evident. Descriptive articles overwhelmingly outnumber manipulative ones. Despite overlap between USVI and Puerto Rican inland aquatic vertebrate faunas, recent surveys from St. Thomas have documented many new records and undescribed aquatic invertebrates. The historical assumption that the two faunas are equivalent appears to depend on taxonomic context.

Several factors could lead to the failure to converge on a consistent topology, including introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, different data types, or insufficient data. We generated three novel whole genome assemblies for Gallus species, which we combined with data from the published genomes of Gallus gallus and Bambusicola thoracicus (a member of the sister genus to Gallus). To determine why previous studies have failed to converge on a single topology, we extracted large numbers of orthologous exons, introns, ultra-conserved elements, and conserved non-exonic elements from the genome assemblies. This provided more than 32 million base pairs of data that we used for concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent analyses of Gallus. All of our analyses, regardless of data type, yielded a single, well-supported topology. We found some evidence for ancient introgression involving specific Gallus lineages as well as modest data type effects that had an impact on support and branch length estimates in specific analyses. However, the estimated gene tree spectra for all data types had a relatively good fit to their expectation given the multispecies coalescent. Overall, our data suggest that conflicts among previous studies probably reflect the use of smaller datasets (both in terms of number of sites and of loci) in those analyses. Our results demonstrate the importance of sampling large numbers of loci, each of which has a sufficient number of sites to provide robust estimates of gene trees. Low-coverage whole genome sequencing, as we did here, represents a cost-effective means to generate the very large data sets that include multiple data types that enabled us to obtain a robust estimate of Gallus phylogeny.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00194-w,avianres.biomedcentral.com,ou,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-7.8794716927245,"['gallus gallus', 'bambusicola thoracicus']",764

The parasiteChonopeltis australisBoxshall, 1976 has been recorded from tributaries of the Orange-Vaal River System. It is host-specific, preferring the cyprinidsLabeo capensis(Smith, 1841) andLabeo umbratus(Smith, 1841). Sampling was conducted between spring 2016 and autumn 2019 at various sites on the main stream of the Vaal River. The current study considers current ecological data and compares these to historic data. The species produces a single cohort, with overwintering eggs and adults. The infection ofL. capensispeaks in autumn. Parasites aggregate on larger hosts that occur in riverine habitats, but can succeed in shallow impoundments with suitable hard surfaces for egg deposition. This parasite exploits changes in ecological conditions and host biology in order to survive, but will only choose between these two host species where they aggregate on larger hosts. The increased pollution in the Vaal River Barrage and downstream has had an impact on the occurrence ofC. australisand it is possibly extirpated in polluted parts of the river.",,nisc.co.za,vaal,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-7.88077908123046,,566

Here, we review the evidence for gene–culture coevolution in animals, especially birds, cetaceans and primates. We describe how culture can relax or intensify selection under different circumstances, create new selection pressures by changing ecology or behaviour, and favour adaptations, including in other species. Finally, we illustrate how, through culturally mediated migration and assortative mating, culture can shape population genetic structure and diversity. This evidence suggests strongly that animal culture plays an important evolutionary role, and we encourage explicit analyses of gene–culture coevolution in nature. The reciprocal interaction between genetic and cultural evolution is well recognised in humans.

Potential hosts might adopt a variety of strategies to defend against cuckoo parasitism, such as attacking adult cuckoos to keep them away from the nest, rejecting cuckoo eggs, or recognizing and refusing to feed cuckoo nestlings. We investigated the strategies used by grey-backed thrushes (Turdus hortulorum), a potential host of cuckoos, to prevent cuckoo or conspecific brood parasitism. Our results indicated that the attack rate of grey-backed thrushes on cuckoo dummies was very low (11.4%). Thrushes showed egg polymorphism and exhibited 100% rejection of non-artificial blue model eggs. Thrushes also failed to identify the eggs (8.3% of rejection) of conspecifics. Thus, grey-backed thrushes show a high egg rejection towards nonmimetic eggs, but low towards conspecific eggs. We suggest that egg recognition and rejection in grey-backed thrushes may be a strategy to cope with interspecific brood parasitism rather than conspecific brood parasitism, and have probably evolved due to previous cuckoo parasitism.

During these inspections, 90 cases of robins nesting in the nestboxes were recorded. Publications on this topic from the entire robin distribution range were reviewed. Robins prefer to nest in old large-sized fairly shallow nestboxes with wide entrance holes, for example starling nestboxes or tit nestboxes with enlarged entrance holes. Increased numbers of nestboxes being occupied by robins were recorded for 3–8 years in row. In Lithuania, nesting success in nestboxes is not higher than compared with nesting on the ground. Tree climbing mammals, Pine Martens (Martes martes), Hazel Dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius), Edible Dormice (Glis glis) and Forest Dormice (Dryomys nitedula), are the main predators of robin nests in nestboxes. Some geographic variation was found in the occurrence of robins nesting in nestboxes with more such cases recorded in central and southern parts of the range.

This review evaluates the reliability and versatility of mtDNA-based techniques to reveal obstacles to the establishment of standard analytical methods, with a particular focus on DNA mixtures. When samples contain a mixture of DNA from multiple species, the interpretation of sequencing analysis results is difficult. Although DNA metabarcoding using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can overcome the DNA mixture problem, DNA metabarcoding is not suitable for the type of small-scale analysis routinely performed by local forensic laboratories, primarily because it is costly and time-consuming.

Here we utilize thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mitochondrial DNA to provide the first genetic assessment of the Australian red-tailed black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii), a widespread bird species comprising populations of varying conservation concern. We identified five evolutionarily significant units, which are estimated to have diverged during the Pleistocene. These units are only partially congruent with the existing morphology-based subspecies taxonomy. Genetic clusters inferred from mitochondrial DNA differed from those based on SNPs and were less resolved. Our study has a range of conservation and taxonomic implications for this species. In particular, we provide advice on the potential genetic rescue of the Endangered and restricted-range subspecies C. b. graptogyne, and propose that the western C. b. samueli population is diagnosable as a separate subspecies. The results of our study highlight the utility of considering the phylogeographic relationships inferred from genome-wide SNPs when characterizing conservation units and management priorities, which is particularly relevant as genomic data sets become increasingly accessible.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-020-0315-y.pdf,nature.com,acanthagenys,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-7.911048699133625,['calyptorhynchus banksii'],708

Recently, two papers by Mandiwana-Neudani et al. (2019a, 2019b) revisited the taxonomy of all Afrotropical spurfowl and francolins and proposed significant changes at the species level. A careful review of the papers suggests there are key deficiencies and inadequate explanations in both. These concerns include doubts about the methodology employed and the proposed taxonomic changes for some 13 species in particular. The methodology employed by the authors is a combination of an ‘organismal’ matrix consisting mainly of plumage patterning, wing/tail/soft part measurements and vocalisation indicators, all allocated a score and then combined with some DNA analysis. For the non-molecular work, there is no explanation of the scientific basis used for the scoring characteristics and the scores allocated. There is also no explanation as to why 33 features were used in the spurfowl paper and only 24 in the francolin paper, particularly where no reference has been made to the age or sex of the birds scored and compared. A concern in the DNA component is that the number of samples is far too few for justifying a significant taxonomic rearrangement covering the whole of Africa. There does not appear to be a single taxon that is represented by more than one genetic sample, which is well outside the norm for robust studies and does not allow for mistakes in the sample labelling or analysis to be detected. In addition to the above concerns, there are many factual errors in both papers pertaining to the text and distribution maps and these are detailed in the individual species’ comments. Based on this analysis, there seems to be good justification in recommending that their taxonomic results and conclusions should be treated with care and caution until additional research is undertaken.",,nisc.co.za,spurfowl,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-7.93340155246648,,354

Objectives We tested the pyrodiversity begets biodiversity theory, which was developed at broader scales, to a scale where land management decisions are commonly made. Methods To assess the effects of landscape attributes on avian species richness, we deployed programmable acoustic recorders at 34 sites in a frequently burned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem which were set to record three, five–minute sessions per day for six days for two years. We identified avian species by their vocalizations and grouped them by nesting and forging guilds to assess the effects of land cover type, soil productivity, forest structure and fire history characteristics including, pyrodiversity on species richness and occupancy at the community, guild, and species levels using hierarchical Bayesian multispecies occupancy models. We defined pyrodiversity as the richness in time since fire values around a site. Results We found support for the pyrodiversity begets biodiversity hypothesis at the community level, as avian species richness increased with pyrodiversity (β = 0.136, 95% CrI 0.009–0.260).

While mating preferences of parental species are well studied, hybrid preferences for cues of parental species have received less attention. Nevertheless, hybrid preferences have potentially important consequences for reproductive isolation and patterns of introgression. Here, we test preferences in wild-caught hybrid chickadees for odor cues from the parental species, black-capped and Carolina chickadees. Olfaction has been historically understudied in avian species, especially passerines, but much recent work has begun to show how olfactory cues play important roles in songbird ecology. In contrast to the strong conspecific odor preferences we previously found in pure-species chickadees, male hybrids as a group show no preference for the odor of either parental species, while still exhibiting individual instances of preference. Female hybrids show preferences for black-capped odor, but this signature is driven by individuals with elevated proportions of black-capped ancestry while Carolina-like female hybrids show no preferences. We discuss the implications of a lack of some female hybrid preferences on reproductive isolation, and the potential for asymmetric preferences in male and black-capped-like female hybrids to contribute to directional introgression and northward movement of the hybrid zone. Significance statement Mate preference has important implications for the fate of natural hybrid zones and the speciation process. Mating discrimination by pure species individuals against hybrids is commonly observed in hybrid zones. However, mate preferences of hybrid individuals for the parental species can be just as important. We previously found that hybrid zone black-capped and Carolina chickadees produce distinct odor profiles and show clear preferences for conspecific odor cues. Here, we assessed preferences of wild-caught hybrid chickadees for the odors of both parental species. In contrast to pure-species birds, hybrid males overall show no preference for either parental species odor as a group. Still, individual males do show clear preferences. Hybrid females show a preference for black-capped odor that is dependent on their own degree of black-capped ancestry. Carolina-like hybrid females show no preferences. Our results suggest the potential for hybrid preference to contribute to reproductive isolation and northward movement of the chickadee hybrid zone.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03069-2.pdf,link.springer.com,chickadee,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-7.93844418882764,,235

For cavity-nester hosts, for instance, nest entrances can reduce parasite access when the latter are larger than the host species, and for at least one group of birds, the weaverbirds, the construction of elongated tubular entrances was hypothesised to reduce interspecific brood parasitism. The function of tubular entrances as antiparasitic defences in closed-nester hosts, however, is one of the less investigated aspects of brood parasitism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nest tubular entrance can reduce parasitism by the Striped Cuckoo, Tapera naevia, in a population of the closed-nester Yellow-chinned Spinetail, Certhiaxis cinnamomeus. We predicted that if the parasite uses a nest entrance to deposit its eggs, either by entering the nest through the tube or making an egg pass through the tube somehow, then nests with tubes that are longer, narrower, curved, and with low inclination would have lower parasitism probability. Modelling analyses, however, suggested this hypothesis should be rejected, as vegetation cover above nests was the only parameter marginally correlated to parasitism probability. As the parasite was too big to pass through the tubular entrance, and no tunnel enlargements that could evidence attempts to enter were observed, our findings were consistent with a model in which T. naevia may lay their eggs at the rim of the tube entrance, and eggs may roll down towards the incubatory chamber, despite tube length, width, and curvature. Parasitism could be facilitated by the downward inclination of most tubes, but it has to be confirmed by direct observations.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43388-021-00037-2.pdf,link.springer.com,arundinicola,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-7.94234618972685,"['striped cuckoo', 'tapera naevia', 'certhiaxis cinnamomeus']",442

In Scandinavia, seabirds are at a heightened risk of extinction due to accelerated global warming. Norway is home to significant portion of the European Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) populations, but Norwegian populations have declined significantly during the last decades. In this paper we use biometric data from modern and archaeological F. arctica specimens to investigate patterns in body size variation over time of this iconic species. We aimed to set out a baseline for our archaeological comparison by firstly investigating whether modern subspecies of F. arctica are reflected in the osteological characters and are enough to distinguish subspecies from the bones alone. We then investigated if archaeological remains of F. arctica differ in size from the modern subspecies. Our results show that the subspecies Fratercula arctica naumanni was distinctly larger than the other subspecies. However, Fratercula arctica arctica and Fratercula arctica grabae were difficult to separate based on size. This generally supports ornithological observations. Post-Medieval F. arctica bones from Måsøy were similar to modern F. a. arctica populations. The mid-Holocene remains from Dollsteinhola overlaps with the modern size ranges of F. a. arctica and F. a. grabae but are generally shorter and more robust. Dollsteinhola is located close to the borders of the modern breeding ranges of both F. a. arctica and F. a. grabae. We consider it therefore likely that given the mid-Holocene climatic oscillations, breeding ranges of the two subspecies shifted north or south accordingly.

To test the effect of eggshell spots on egg recognition, pure white eggs of the White-rumped Munia (Lonchura striata) and eggs of White-rumped Munia painted with red brown spots were used to simulate experimental parasitism. Egg experiments showed that Cinereous Tits rejected 51.5% of pure white eggs of the White-rumped Munia, but only 14.3% of spotted eggs of the White-rumped Munia. There was a significant difference in egg recognition and rejection rate between the two egg types. We conclude that eggshell spots on Cinereous Tit eggs had a signaling function and may be essential to tits for recognizing and rejecting parasitic eggs.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0178-1,avianres.biomedcentral.com,tit-warbler,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.9609564608029,"['parus cinereus', 'cuckoo', 'lonchura striata']",929

Identification ptilology is developing in close cooperation with aviation ornithology. The article contains an analysis of data from foreign and domestic literature on the impact of identification ptilology on aviation ornithology, as well as the development of applied, organizational, and strategic issues of the latter. Specific examples of the taxonomic identification of feathers by the micro- and macrostructure are given; the role of some features of the feather microstructure for examination and phylogenetic constructions is determined. A system of diagnostic features of a single feather has been developed, several new feather elements have been described, and the information on the known feather structures has been supplemented. Mathematical methods (clustering of the feather microstructural compartments based on morphometric data) were used to determine the phylogenetic relationships between higher and middle rank taxa. The role of bird collections and bird identification systems based on the macro- and microstructure of feathers for identification studies of feather material has been determined. The applied and scientific means of solving the problems of airfield ecology, namely, the protection of aircraft from biological damage caused by birds, are considered. The need to identify species involved in collisions with aircraft is noted. A project on physical, geographical, and climatic zoning has been started. The goal of the project is to identify the most dangerous bird species for aviation flights in the areas and territories of airports in different seasons of the year. Complex systems of bird-species identification based on feather remains have been developed for aviation ornithology, which includes analysis of the feather-structure material, ecological-geographical and molecular genetic analyses; and a set of methods that allows the processing of large data sets exclusively on the structure of feather groups, a single feather, or its fragments.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S2079086422020098.pdf,link.springer.com,go-away-bird,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-7.98767413164668,,14

Background: Tropical montane cloud forests are one of the most important hotspots on Earth and show presence of 
relict‑endemic and endangered species, representing about 14% of the total tropical forest worldwide. Synchronous 
seed production or masting in tropical montane cloud tree species is a widespread reproductive strategy of decidu‑
ous and evergreen broad‑leaved tree associations to decrease costs of reproduction and ensure offspring. Masting 
event maintains a high avian diversity, which can be modified by phenological process (seed production and non‑
seed production).
Methods: The main aim of this study was to assess alpha and beta avian diversity and whether the composition of 
the trophic guild modifies among phenological processes and between two fragmented relict‑endangered Mexican 
Beech (Fagus grandifolia subsp. mexicana) forests (Medio Monte and El Gosco) in the Mexican state of Hidalgo. In addi‑
tion, we evaluated beechnut production.
Results: We recorded 36 bird species, 11 of them included in some conservation risk status, and 5 endemic species. 
Alpha diversity values were dissimilar in avian richness (q = 0) among phenological processes and between frag‑
mented beech forests. Avian communities among three phenological processes and between fragmented forests 
were structurally similar, dominated during immature seeds the Brown‑backed Solitaire (granivores–insectivores–
frugivores); during mature seeds the White‑crowned Parrot (Pionus senilis, granivores–frugivores); and the Dwarf Jay 
(Cyanolyca nana, insectivores) was abundant during low seed quality. The complementarity index was high among 
phenological processes and low between forests. We found a high bird turnover value between immature seeds—
mature seeds and during mature seeds—low seed quality. Furthermore, a similar pattern was recorded between the 
two study forests. Seed production showed a high number of undamaged beechnuts in Medio Monte, while in El 
Gosco beechnuts were attacked by insects.
Conclusions: Our results reflect that masting phenological process and contrasting study forests’ structure influence 
the shifts in alpha and beta diversity of seed and non‑seed bird consumers. Our study reaffirms the importance of 
continuing studies throughout masting in all the Mexican Beech forests to address regional efforts in preserving the 
relict‑ecological interactions.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00284-3.pdf,avianres.biomedcentral.com,solitaire,2022-04-09,0,1,1,1,1,-7.98987775342084,"['dwarf jay', 'pionus senilis', 'cyanolyca nana']",199

The conservation status of the Critically Endangered Preuss’s red colobus (P. preussi), found in southeastern Nigeria and western Cameroon, is not well understood, impeding conservation efforts. We reviewed historical records and recent data on the distribution and abundance of Preuss’s red colobus to assess the species’ population status and provide recommendations for its conservation. Preuss’s red colobus has historically been found in two widely separated populations: one in the contiguous transboundary forests of Nigeria’s Cross River National Park (Oban) and Cameroon’s Korup National Park, and the other in Cameroon’s Ebo–Makombe–Ndokbou forests. Today, Preuss’s red colobus is mostly restricted to Korup and Oban and has largely disappeared from the Ebo–Makombe–Ndokbou forests. Systematic surveys indicate that the population in Korup, where Preuss’s red colobus reaches its highest density, has declined over the last 30 years with possibly 3290–4430 red colobus monkeys remaining. Improving protection of the Korup–Oban population, through improved law enforcement, transboundary conservation, ecological monitoring, and engagement with adjacent local communities, is essential to secure the long-term survival of Preuss’s red colobus. Locating and protecting remnant groups in other forests is also urgently needed.

This is often expressed, and measured, as genetic and behavioral variation among populations. Suboscine birds acquire songs by innate mechanisms and are typically poorly studied relative to oscine birds, which may learn songs and thus develop unique dialects among populations. Behavioral features, including song, are extensively used to describe the structure and geographical variation in bird populations. In turn, this knowledge may shed light onto patterns of species diversification across ecoregions, which is particularly relevant in endemic species. Here we investigate for the first time song structure and variation in the Silvery-cheeked Antshrike, an endemic bird of a poorly studied South American dry forest, the Caatinga. We evaluate hypotheses for song diversification, correlating vocal acoustic parameters with geographic patterns and environmental variables. We measured temporal and spectral variables in the song of Sakesphorus cristatus across 14 localities spanning almost the entire range of the species’ distribution. The song presents a clear geographic pattern, and vocal variation was congruent with a barrier by the São Francisco River superimposed to a latitudinal clinal variation that was uncorrelated to climate variables. We argue that these regional differences may have a genetic basis since S. cristatus is a suboscine antbird that should not show song learning (social adaptation) and, apparently, does not have the song correlated to habitat features (acoustic adaptation). More detailed studies are required to test further hypotheses about the drivers of this potential genetic variation underlying the geographical variation in this suboscine bird song.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-020-01779-4.pdf,link.springer.com,warbling-antbird,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.00290167183531,['sakesphorus cristatus'],716

Using gene expression level of blood HSP70 and HSP90 as indicators, we compared the cell stress response of Asian Short-toed Lark (Calandrella cheleensis) nestlings hatched under conditions of low, mid or high food (grasshopper nymph) availability in 2017.

Selection against choosiness may be particularly strong in socially monogamous mating systems, because females may end up without a partner and forego reproduction, especially when many females prefer the same few partners (frequency-dependent selection). Here, we quantify the fitness costs of having mating preferences that are difficult to satisfy, by manipulating the availability of preferred males. We capitalize on the recent discovery that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males of familiar song dialect. We measured female fitness in captive breeding colonies in which one-third of females were given ample opportunity to choose a mate of their preferred dialect (two-thirds of all males; “relaxed competition”), while two-thirds of the females had to compete over a limited pool of mates they preferred (one-third of all males; “high competition”). As expected, social pairings were strongly assortative with regard to song dialect. In the high-competition group, 26% of the females remained unpaired, yet they still obtained relatively high fitness by using brood parasitism as an alternative reproductive tactic. Another 31% of high-competition females paired disassortatively for song dialect. These females showed increased levels of extra-pair paternity, mostly with same-dialect males as sires, suggesting that preferences were not abolished after social pairing. However, females that paired disassortatively for song dialect did not have lower reproductive success. Overall, females in the high-competition group reached equal fitness to those that experienced relaxed competition. Our study suggests that alternative reproductive tactics such as egg dumping can help overcome the frequency-dependent costs of being selective in a monogamous mating system, thereby facilitating the evolution of female choosiness.",https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001257&type=printable,journals.plos.org,capuchinbird,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.01816150887688,['taeniopygia guttata'],167

Animals should therefore be more reluctant to leave a foraging patch when their energy reserves are low and should flee using low-energy escape tactics, but be quicker to flee and use the best escape tactic when satiated. Nectarivorous birds have little capacity for energy storage; thus, they should be particularly sensitive to variation in nutritional status throughout the day. We tested whether New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) alter their antipredator behavior by testing whether flight initiation distance (FID—the distance at which an individual flees from an approaching predator) and escape tactic (hopping or flying) vary over the course of the day. Honeyeater FID was shortest in the morning, following the overnight fast, and longest at midday. In the evening, though FID tended to shorten, responses were more variable overall, likely due to individual variation in foraging success. In the morning, honeyeaters were equally likely to hop or fly when approached, but increasingly favored flight as the day progressed. These results suggest a strong link between individual energetic condition and antipredator responses. We suggest that time of day is a useful and important variable influencing escape behavior, the potential effects of which should be more consistently considered as a covariate in the widely used FID protocol. Significance statement Diel variation in internal and external conditions can alter behavioral responses. In this study, we observed antipredator response behaviors in foraging New Holland honeyeaters, small passerines sensitive to changes in energy status throughout the day. We found that honeyeaters allowed researchers to approach more closely in the morning and evening before fleeing and escaped by flying more often than hopping as the day progressed. Our results suggest that antipredator behaviors are sensitive to current energy status and impending energy needs. In addition, we show that time of day is an important consideration in the experimental design and statistical analysis of behavior studies.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-019-2757-x.pdf,link.springer.com,phylidonyris,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.028811438762283,['phylidonyris novaehollandiae'],883

Reports of stranded sea lion pups are becoming common in Chile, presumably due to the increase in the frequency and intensity of coastal storms. To validate this assumption, a 10-year database was built by coupling wave generation and coastal propagation models to correlate pure wave parameters (significant wave height Hs, peak period Tp, normalized wave power Hs2 Tp) and wave parameters including the tidal level (maximum surface elevation η, modified wave power η2 Tp) with records of stranded pups in Cobquecura, the largest breeding colony in central Chile. The correlation between the number of pups stranded per day and wave parameters in the first half of January and the last half of February is poor, while they are stronger for the second half of January and the first half of February. The higher number of stranded pups coincide with coastal storms with normalized wave power values exceeding a threshold of 100 m2/s. Conversely, below this threshold there is wide dispersion between the number of strandings and wave parameters. Identifying wave parameter thresholds could be used to predict when newborn pups will be most affected by coastal storms, and thus help institutions to develop remediation techniques for animals at risk.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69124-6.pdf,nature.com,shoa,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-8.03443083958945,,629

Female Anna’s Hummingbirds (Calypte anna) show substantial individual variation in the number of pink, male-like gorget feathers. Here, on a sample of nearly 500 female Anna’s Hummingbirds recaptured up to 11 years after banding, we show that gorget size increases substantially when the birds molt from immature into adult plumage. Thereafter, gorget size barely increased with age, meaning that age explains little of the individual variation in number of male-like feathers once a female is adult. A recent study suggested that female polymorphism is widespread in hummingbirds. We reassessed 13 species and show that, relative to adult females, the other “morphs” are actually: immature females; mis-sexed immature or adult males; products of inaccurate field-guide depictions of plumage; an invented morph; subspecific plumage variation; or the conflation of statistical bimodality with polymorphism. We conclude that, although many species of hummingbird show high variation in female plumage, true female polymorphism has only been convincingly demonstrated in perhaps three species (0.9% of hummingbirds). The most striking example is the White-necked Jacobin (Florisuga mellivora). This species appears unique in that adult, breeding females come in two morphs, one that is essentially indistinguishable from the brightly colored males, and the other that is dull and lacks iridescent feathers.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-022-01975-4.pdf,link.springer.com,lancebill,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.04399909660038,"['calypte anna', 'florisuga mellivora']",36

Although many studies about urban filtering have included bird communities, few have focused on diverse and specialized groups, such as hummingbirds. Here, we investigate if: (1) the urbanization process may have modified the phylogenetic and phenotypic structure of regional hummingbird assemblages in five cities along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico, and (2) hummingbird species in urban environments have been filtered through the selection of particular morphological traits. We measured eight morphological traits related to the ability of hummingbird species to use resources, three of which (wing chord, culmen and bill curvature) were retained for phenotypic analyses. We estimated phylogenetic (MPD, mean pairwise distance, and MNTD, mean nearest taxon distance) and phenotypic structure values (pMPD and pMNTD) in regional and urban hummingbird assemblages, which allowed us to assess significant phylogenetic structure and phenotypic similarity among coexisting species, respectively. We also calculated phylogenetic signal to determine if traits are labile or conserved. We performed generalized linear mixed-effect models and a classification and regression tree analysis to determine which traits explained species’ presence in urban environments. Our results showed that urbanization modified the phylogenetic structure from a random pattern in regional assemblages towards more overdispersed values in urban assemblages, while phenotypic structure values changed either towards clustering or overdispersion in the different cities. Regression tree analyses showed that traits related to body-size and bill culmen may influence the presence of different hummingbird species in cities. Our results show that the urbanization process may change the phylogenetic and phenotypic structure of hummingbird assemblages, favoring species with generalist morphologies (intermediate body-sizes and relatively longer bills).",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10682-020-10055-z.pdf,link.springer.com,lampornis,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.044607178878506,,719

To achieve these aims, 12 behavioral, one physiological, and four physical indicators of welfare and adaptation potential were measured non-invasively on 25 orphaned rhino at two rehabilitation facilities in South Africa. Results indicated that although orphan welfare was not compromised under either rehabilitation method, the hands-off cohort showed fewer indicators of poor welfare and more indicators of good welfare. Regarding adaptation potential, hands-off rehabilitated rhino showed the species’ natural response to humans, and alert and defense behaviors were part of their behavioral repertoire. The hands-on cohort displayed fewer social interactions than the hands-off cohort, showed habituation to humans, and seldom expressed alert or defense behaviors, which could potentially compromise their survival and social integration after release. Post-release studies are required to confirm whether fitness is compromised in hands-on rehabilitated rhino.

During the same period, numbers of two sympatric and ecologically-similar congeners, the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) and Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) showed increases or stability. It has been suggested that these opposing population trends could have a causal relationship, as Mute and Whooper Swans are larger and competitively dominant to Bewick’s Swans in foraging situations. If so, effects of competition of Mute and Whooper Swans on Bewick’s Swans should be detectable as measurable impacts on behaviour and energetics. Here, we studied the diurnal behaviour and energetics of 1083 focal adults and first-winter juveniles (“cygnets”) of the three swan species on their winter grounds in eastern England. We analysed video recordings to derive time-activity budgets and these, together with estimates of energy gain and expenditure, were analysed to determine whether individual Bewick’s Swans altered the time spent on key behaviours when sharing feeding habitat with other swan species, and any consequences for their energy expenditure and net energy gain. All three swan species spent a small proportion of their total time (0.011) on aggressive interactions, and these were predominantly intraspecific (≥ 0.714). Mixed-effects models indicated that sharing feeding habitat with higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans increased the likelihood of engaging in aggression for cygnet Bewick’s Swans, but not for adults. Higher levels of interspecific competition decreased the time spent by Bewick’s Swan cygnets on foraging, whilst adults showed the opposite pattern. When among low densities of conspecifics (< c. 200 individuals/km2), individual Bewick’s Swans spent more time on vigilance in the presence of higher densities of Mute and Whooper Swans, whilst individuals within higher density Bewick’s Swan flocks showed the opposite pattern. Crucially, we found no evidence that greater numbers of interspecific competitors affected the net energy gain of either adult or cygnet Bewick’s Swans. We found no evidence that Bewick’s Swan net energy gain was affected by sharing agricultural feeding habitat with larger congeners during winter. This was despite some impacts on the aggression, foraging and vigilance behaviours of Bewick’s Swans, especially among cygnets. It is unlikely therefore that competition between Bewick’s Swans and either Mute or Whooper Swans at arable sites in winter has contributed to the observed decline in Bewick’s Swan numbers. Further research is needed, however, to test for competition in other parts of the flyway, including migratory stopover sites and breeding areas.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00282-5,avianres.biomedcentral.com,donaldson-smith,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.06587171367972,"['cygnus olor', 'cygnus cygnus', 'mute swan', 'cygnus columbianus', 'whooper swan']",211

The possibility that interaction rules may change under different circumstances has thus only rarely been investigated. Here we show that local interactions in flocks of wild jackdaws (Corvus monedula) vary drastically in different contexts, leading to distinct group-level properties. Jackdaws interact with a fixed number of neighbours (topological interactions) when traveling to roosts, but coordinate with neighbours based on spatial distance (metric interactions) during collective anti-predator mobbing events. Consequently, mobbing flocks exhibit a dramatic transition from disordered aggregations to ordered motion as group density increases, unlike transit flocks where order is independent of density. The relationship between group density and group order during this transition agrees well with a generic self-propelled particle model. Our results demonstrate plasticity in local interaction rules and have implications for both natural and artificial collective systems. Modelling collective behaviour in different circumstances remains a challenge because of uncertainty related to interaction rule changes.

This was subsequently confirmed after consultations with expert ornithologists from Indonesia and around the region. “It feels surreal to know that we have found a species of bird presumed by experts to be extinct. When we found it, we didn't expect it to be that special at all – we thought it was just another bird that we simply have never seen before”, said Rizky Fauzan. The Black-browed Babbler was described by the noted French ornithologist, Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850 based on a specimen collected some time in the 1840s by German geologist and naturalist, Carl A.L.M.

Male plumage colors are generally more elaborate and diverse than female colors, and in many species only males sing, so both of these dimorphisms are widely presumed to have evolved through sexual selection on males. Yet, in multiple widely divergent songbird clades, sexual differences in colors and songs have evolved through losses in females rather than gains in males. Indeed, changes in female phenotypes may be the principle driving factor affecting such sexual dimorphisms in most songbirds. Sexual dichromatism and song dimorphism also tend to be associated with life history traits other than mating system, such as seasonal migration or territorial behaviors. Altogether, these recent findings support the view that sexual dimorphism is an evolutionary byproduct of multiple, different selection pressures acting on each sex rather than just sexual selection on males. Researchers should therefore be cautious to avoid assuming that dimorphism itself is a character solely reflecting levels of sexual selection in species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01681-8.pdf,link.springer.com,oropendola,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.09512045022328,,1040

However, empirical evidence from historically documented colonisations suggest that, in most cases, drift alone is not sufficient to explain the rate of morphological divergence. Here, using the human-mediated introduction of the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) to French Polynesia, which represents a potentially extreme example of population founding, we reassess the potential for morphological shifts to arise via drift alone. Despite only 80 years of separation from their New Zealand ancestors, French Polynesian silvereyes displayed significant changes in body and bill size and shape, most of which could be accounted for by drift, without the need to invoke selection. However, signatures of selection at genes previously identified as candidates for bill size and body shape differences in a range of bird species, also suggests a role for selective processes in driving morphological shifts within this population. Twenty-four SNPs in our RAD-Seq dataset were also found to be strongly associated with phenotypic variation. Hence, even under population founding extremes, when it is difficult to reject drift as the sole mechanism based on rate tests of phenotypic shifts, the additional role of divergent natural selection in novel environments can be revealed at the level of the genome.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-020-0298-8.pdf,nature.com,silvereye,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.099910905768176,"['silvereye', 'zosterops lateralis']",790

Despite having evolved widely in animals, laterality of limb use has been mostly studied in humans and other primates (e.g. handedness) and is relatively poorly understood in other taxa. Perhaps accordingly, the possibility of geographic variation in laterality has been largely overlooked. Foot preferences in parrots have been established as a tractable model for behavioural laterality investigations. Here we tested for geographic and temporal variation in lateralization of foot use in an Australian parrot complex, the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans). We observed lateralization of foot use during foraging in N = 458 wild individuals over nine years, from 42 locations and four subspecies. We show, for the first time to our knowledge in any animal, a cline in laterality. In the morphologically highly variable P. e. adelaidae subspecies, which occupies a marked latitudinal habitat cline, we show that right side lateralization increased at higher (more southerly) latitudes. We also found ambidexterity varied between subspecies, and was present almost exclusively in the morphologically intermediate populations which occupy intermediate habitats, reaching 11% of individuals in one such population. Across all populations, strong lateralization at individual and population levels existed, with 93% of birds consistently lateralized, and 64% using the right foot preferentially. Age, year, season, or whether the bird was perched or on the ground, had no effects on foot preference. Using captive birds, we show that foot preferences were largely stable within individuals over time. Our findings provide rare examples of an intraspecific cline in behavioural lateralization and population differences in ambidexterity, and provide novel support for the hypothesis that ecological factors such as habitat and/or diet influences behavioural laterality within free-living animals.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10682-020-10069-7.pdf,link.springer.com,rosella,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.10162699257569,"['platycercus elegans', 'crimson rosella']",601

Ixodes anatis Chilton, 1904, is an endophilic, nidicolous species endemic to North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) (NIBK) and the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), and little is known about the environmental conditions required for its development. The aims of this study were to determine and compare the conditions of temperature and RH that ensure the best survival of the kiwi tick and the shortest interstadial periods, in laboratory conditions and outdoors inside artificial kiwi burrows. Methods Free-walking engorged ticks were collected off wild kiwi hosts and placed in the laboratory under various fixed temperature and humidity regimes. In addition, sets of the collected ticks at different developmental stages were placed in artificial kiwi burrows. In both settings, we recorded the times taken for the ticks to moult to the next stage. Results Larvae and nymphs both showed optimum development at between 10 °C and 20 °C, which is lower than the optimum temperature for development in many other species of ixodid ticks. However, larvae moulted quicker and survived better when saturation deficits were < 1–2 mmHg (RH > 94%); in comparison, the optimum saturation deficits for nymph development were 1–10 mmHg. Conclusions Our results suggest that the kiwi tick has adapted to the stable, but relatively cool and humid conditions in kiwi burrows, reflecting the evolutionary consequences of its association with the kiwi.

Such traits are often highly variable, possibly because of condition-dependence and/or high underlying genetic variation, and it has been suggested that their expression should be more sensitive to condition and/or more heritable than non-ornamental traits. Many bird species display colourful plumage with multiple distinct patches of different developmental origins, forming complex colour phenotypes. Despite this complexity, colourful ornaments are often studied in isolation, without comparison to suitable non-ornamental controls. Based on plumage reflectance data collected over 8 years, we assessed the signalling potential of the multidimensional male colour phenotype in a tropical bird: the purple-crowned fairy-wren Malurus coronatus. Specifically, we tested the predictions that the expression of putative ornamental colours (purple and black – the breeding colours – and blue) is (1) more variable, (2) more heritable and (3) more condition-dependent compared to year-round non-ornamental colours (buff-white and brown). Our results show that ornamental colours exhibit greater levels of variability, and some chromatic components of purple and blue colouration appear slightly heritable (h² = 0.19–0.30). However, contrary to predictions of heightened condition-dependence in ornaments, only brightness of the buff-white and brown colouration increased with male body condition, although brightness of the purple colouration was related to male age as expected. Despite partial support for predictions, the lack of consistent patterns illustrates the complexity of visual signals and highlights the need to study colour phenotypes in their entirety.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-021-00453-6.pdf,nature.com,fairy-wren,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.10516581590954,"['malurus coronatus', 'wren']",295

Nevertheless, the effect of flowerpiercers seems to vary according to their behavior and the flower’s traits. So, in this work, we aimed to explore the floral characteristics that may determine the susceptibility to robbing and pollen transport by flowerpiercers. Also, we identified the potential types of interactions and studied interaction network properties. We collected the information of 16 ornithophilic plants regarding their floral traits and robbing frequency. Also, we captured 4 species of flowerpiercers and evaluated pollen transport (frequency and loads). We tested the correlation between floral traits, robbing frequency, and pollen transportation. Later, we used these variables in a cluster and principal component analyses to identify the potential types of interactions. Finally, we analyzed and compared the structure of the plants-flowerpiercers interaction network. Nectar production significantly influenced both nectar robbing and pollen transportation. While the corolla length was only correlated to the robbing susceptibility. Also, we found that particular flowerpiercers species transported higher loads of some plant pollen, which can be related to the differences in behavior and morphometric traits. We proposed the classification of five different types of plant-flowerpiercer interactions, that showed different potential mutualist or antagonist relations based on the affectation of nectar robbing and the service of pollen transportation. The interaction networks consisted of 49 links, with 2.4 links per species, and presented indicators of a medium to high resilience, stability, and resistance (nestedness, connectance, and robustness). Also, the network presented medium to low specialization and substantial niche overlap.

These calls often recruit nearby conspecifics and heterospecifics to help drive the predators away. In some species, such as members of the family Paridae, mobbing calls are composed of multiple elements that seem to follow a characteristic order. Previous work in parids demonstrated that note ordering influences both the responses of conspecifics and some other co-occurring Paridae species. Cross-species sensitivity to note ordering could result from individuals’ learning to associate individual heterospecific calls with threats or, rather, because the typical note orderings are shared across species. Here, we test these hypotheses by assessing the responses of European great tits (Parus major) to the naturally and artificially ordered calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), a North American species. In response to the naturally ordered mobbing calls of chickadees, we found that great tits exhibit vigilance and rapidly approach the sound source, behaviors that were indistinguishable to those expressed in response to conspecific calls. If learned associations are necessary for sensitivity to note ordering, then a key prediction is that great tit responses to naturally ordered and artificially reversed chickadee calls should be similar (and weak). In contrast to this prediction, we found that great tits were less vigilant, but approach the sound source in response to artificially reversed chickadee calls. These findings suggest that perception of note ordering patterns is conserved. However, they are also in agreement with a “perception bias” hypothesis: that the first notes of the call mask the notes that follow them, preventing the receiver from perceiving the second part of the call. Although we provide evidence against perception bias, further research is needed to convincingly disentangle these two hypotheses. Significance statement How do animals decode other species’ vocal sequences? Great tit responses to chickadee sequences depend on the ordering of their notes. Great tits and chickadees never encounter one another in the wild, but their alarm call sequences have similar note orderings. Using a series of playback experiments, we demonstrate that great tits respond strongest to chickadee calls whose order matches their own. Thus, response to unfamiliar calls does not depend on learning, but, rather, shared call ordering across species.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-020-2820-7.pdf,link.springer.com,pardo,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.12403672114272,"['poecile atricapillus', 'great tit', 'parus major']",771

The implementation of such measures should be a priority in oceanic islands because biodiversity hotspots are concentrated in these locations. Furthermore, anthropogenic changes have a greater impact on island species than on their mainland relatives.

The latter aspect is due to attempts by the tourist industry to stimulate the economy in this area. Thus, the environment and biota are under new pressures. There are few studies on the effects of wildlife roadkill in the Galápagos. We surveyed two stretches of a 13.8-km road in two different vegetation zones on the island of Santa Cruz. This island has the highest population and the greatest number of tourists in the archipelago. We determined the spatial patterns of bird roadkill using counts, which were conducted via bicycle rides. We recorded 168 carcasses comprising seven species (six native and one invasive). Roadkill did not occur at the same rate over the two stretches: it was significantly higher over Stretch 1, which had a greater volume of traffic. Neither were species equally distributed over the stretches. We identified a high-mortality black spot within Stretch 1 in an area in which high-speed traffic may have contributed strongly to roadkill. We also estimated the carcass disappearance rate to better determine the roadkill rate. Data on the disappearance rate could be of help in the design and implementation of future studies. This study presents the first data on the road mortality rate in the Galápagos Islands, finding that it is much higher than in other natural areas. This represents a first step toward minimizing the growing threat to Galápagos birds, and provides a basis for future research on conservation management plans in the Galápagos Islands.

The cave preserves an extensive stratigraphic sequence made up of eight units, which is presented in depth in this work. The main goal of this study is to undertake an initial spatial examination of Unit III, formed during Marine Isotope Stage 3, with the aim of understanding spatial organization and past activities developed by Neanderthals and carnivores (bears, hyenas and smaller carnivores). The total sample analysed includes 38,244 archaeological items and 5888 limestone blocks. The application of GIS tools allows us to clearly distinguish three geologically-defined stratigraphic subunits. Unit III has been previously interpreted as a palimpsest resulting from alternating occupation of the cave by human groups and carnivores. The distribution study shows that faunal specimens, lithic artefacts, hearths and charcoal fragments are significantly concentrated at the entrance of the cave where, it is inferred, hominins carried out different activities, while carnivores preferred the sheltered zones in the inner areas of the cave. The results obtained reveal a spatial pattern characterized by fire use related zones, and show that the site was occupied by Neanderthals in a similar and consistent way throughout the ˃ 7000&nbsp;years range covered by the analysed subunits.

There are often sexual conflicts between male and female individuals in the expression of antiparasitic behavior due to the differences in reproductive inputs and division of labor. By adding a foreign egg made of blue soft clay to the host nest during early incubation period in the field, and by removing several host eggs and adding experimental eggs to control the proportion of two egg types in the nest, we examined egg rejection ability, egg recognition mechanism and sexual difference in egg rejection of the Oriental Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis), one of the major hosts of Common Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus). Our results indicated that Oriental Reed Warblers can recognize and reject nearly 100% (73/75) of the non-mimetic eggs made of blue soft clay, and they could reject foreign eggs with 100% accuracy, regardless of the ratio of experimental eggs and its own eggs in the nest. Furthermore, all cases of egg rejections recorded by videos were only carried out by females. Oriental Reed Warblers have a high egg recognition ability and show a true recognition mechanism.

Metal(loid)s may interact with plastic in the environment and there is mixed evidence about whether plastic ingested by wildlife affects metal(loid) absorption/assimilation and concentration in the body. We examined ingested plastic and liver concentration of eleven metal(loid)s in two seabird species: fairy (Pachyptila turtur) and slender-billed prions (P. belcheri). We found significant relationships between ingested plastic and the concentrations of aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the liver of prions. We investigated whether the pattern of significant relationships reflected plastic-metal(loid) associations predicted in the scientific literature, including by transfer of metals from ingested plastics or malnutrition due to dietary dilution by plastics in the gut. We found some support for both associations, suggesting that ingested plastic may be connected with dietary dilution / lack of essential nutrients, especially iron, and potential transfer of zinc. We did not find a relationship between plastic and non-essential metal(loid)s, including lead. The effect of plastic was minor compared to that of dietary exposure to metal(oid)s, and small plastic loads (&lt; 3 items) had no discernible link with metal(loid)s.

After seven years of effort, Courtois's Laughingthrush Garrulax galbanus courtoisi, hitherto only known from two museum specimens collected in 1919, was 'rediscovered' in 2000 at its type locality, Wuyuan, Jiangxi Province, China. Unlike most other Laughingthrushes studied to date, Garrulax galbanus courtoisi nests in loose colonies. More intriguing still, is that despite intensive survey efforts covering all types of habitats, the bird has so far only been found in stands of old village trees, which villagers in this part of China have protected for generations. Only some 150-160 surviving birds are known to date, making this taxon one of the rarest birds in the world. A bird whose survival up to now and well into the future may be dependent on a regional tradition of protecting old village trees. Efforts, both domestic and international, to rediscover Courtois's Laughingthrush, a subspecies of Yellow-throated Laughingthrush Garrulax galbanus, at its type locality have continued for years but have now finally shown some dramatic and positive results. Furthermore, data recently obtained on the status and breeding behaviour of this heretofore unstudied bird is demonstrating to us something more than mere taxonomy. Courtois’s Laughingthrush © Xi Zhi-nong For the whole story of the discovery of the bird, a British topographical surveyor, Colonel Godwin-Austen, constitutes the very beginning. In 1874, Colonel Godwin-Austen described a new species of laughingthrush, Garrulax galbanus, based on skins he obtained in February 1873 in the Munipur valley, eastern Assam, India, (1) from which area the species is now mostly known by its English name, the Yellow-throated Laughingthrush. Later on, in 1923, M. A. Ménégaux, President of the Société Ornithologique de France, recognised another laughingthrush species, Garrulaxcourtoisi, based on two bird skins collected in September 1919 by a French missionary Père A. Riviere, from Wuyuan in south-east China and sent to him by Père F. Courtois. (2,3) And, although the direct distance from Munipur to Wuyuan is at least 2000 kilometres, and no record of either of the two birds had been reported at any site between the two localities at that time, courtoisi was nevertheless soon after relegated to the status of a subspecies of Garrulax galbanus. (4) More than half a century then passed before in 1982 two Chinese ornithologists, Prof. Cheng Tso-hsin and Tang Rui-chang, described one more subspecies of galbanus, and since the three specimens were collected at Simao in Yunnan Province, south-west China, the new subspecies was named simaoensis. (5) Therefore, three subspecies of the Yellow-throated Laughing-thrush have so far been recognised - the nominate form distributed in the area where the Indian sub-continent meets Indochina, and the other two in mainland China. Although Simao lies more or less between Munipur and Wuyuan, it is apparent that the Yellow-throated Laughingthrush shows a completely allopatric pattern in the ranges of its three subspecies. (6,7) It is now known that the nominate form, whose type locality is Munipur, can also be found in a relatively large surrounding area, including the Chin Hills of western Myanmar (Burma) and also as far afield as a small area in southern Bangladesh. (8,9) According to Smythies, it is locally 'a common breeding bird of the Chin Hills at 5,000-6,000 feet from mid-April to early June'. (10,11) In contrast, nothing new came to be known of either a geographical or ethological nature about the two Chinese subspecies. In fact, until our recent success, no-one, neither professional ornithologist nor keen bird watcher, had reported having so much as seen a courtoisi or simaoensis, whether in their type localities or elsewhere, since the type specimens were collected in 1919 and 1956, respectively. This implied that they were restricted to a rather small area, and/or in a rather specific habitat, and/or had been reduced to very small surviving numbers - all of which have proven to be true for courtoisi. Simaoensis has yet to be rediscovered. It should be noted, however, that their elusiveness in the wild notwithstanding, there are several populations of Yellow-throated Laughingthrush in European collections, which apparently are self-sustaining, (11) and some bird keepers believe that the birds they have are of the subspecies simaoensis. (12) If the birds are simaoensis, it is far from clear how they could have reached Europe, and from whence they came. An exhaustive search of all original customs documents relating to passerine birds exported from China revealed no record of Yellow-throated Laughingthrush.",,orientalbirdclub.org,baza,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-8.15286230852391,['garrulax galbanus'],1000

Methods Bird occurrence data, landscape and regional land-cover data, costs of false-positive and false-negative errors, and the C5.0 decision tree algorithm were used to train and test a binary classifier. Results Increasing the cost for false negatives tended to decrease the frequency of this error type while allowing for reasonable predictive performance for each class separately and both classes combined.

Post-mortem examination and toxicological analysis are essential for a proper diagnosis of the cause of the poisoning. However, investigators often require an estimate of the time of death, which is best determined by identifying the stage of carcass decomposition. The aim of this article is to propose a scoring method to classify the stages of carcass decomposition and thus provide an estimate of the time of death in small-size raptors. This protocol can be used by practitioners, forensic veterinarians, researchers, authorities and personnel collecting carcasses in order to standardize methods and minimize subjectivity. For this purpose, 12 carcasses of Common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) were exposed to external weather conditions (in the period 4–19 July 2019) in Murcia, Southeastern Spain. The ambient temperature and relative humidity, body core temperatures and carcass weights were measured at intervals over the study period. Necropsies were performed (2 birds at each interval) at 1–2 h, 24 h, 72 h, 96 h, 7 days and 15 days after death. The necropsy of a previously frozen bird was performed to act as a comparison with non-frozen fresh individuals. Six stages of the post-mortem autolytic process were selected: fresh carcass, moderate decomposition, advanced decomposition, very advanced decomposition, initial skeletal reduction and complete skeletal reduction. To classify the carcasses according to these categories, a scoring method is proposed considering 5 parameters: state of the eyeballs, tongue/oral cavity, pectoral muscle, internal organs and other features. Several parameters affecting the process of the decomposition are discussed.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10344-020-01429-3.pdf,link.springer.com,charlton,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.1580346784293,"['common kestrel', 'falco tinnunculus']",539

So far, apart from humans such behaviour has only been experimentally shown in chimpanzees and in Eurasian jays. Recent studies highlight the prosocial tendencies of several bird species, yet flexible targeted helping remained untested, largely due to methodological issues as such tasks are generally designed around tool-use, and very few bird species are capable of tool-use. Here, we tested Goffin’s cockatoos, which proved to be skilled tool innovators in captivity, in a tool transfer task in which an actor had access to four different objects/tools and a partner to one of two different apparatuses that each required one of these tools to retrieve a reward. As expected from this species, we recorded playful object transfers across all conditions. Yet, importantly and similar to apes, three out of eight birds transferred the correct tool more often in the test condition than in a condition that also featured an apparatus but no partner. Furthermore, one of these birds transferred that correct tool first more often before transferring any other object in the test condition than in the no-partner condition, while the other two cockatoos were marginally non-significantly more likely to do so. Additionally, there was no difference in the likelihood of the correct tool being transferred first for either of the two apparatuses, suggesting that these birds flexibly adjusted what to transfer based on their partner´s need. Future studies should focus on explanations for the intra-specific variation of this behaviour, and should test other parrots and other large-brained birds to see how this can be generalized across the class and to investigate the evolutionary history of this trait.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253416&type=printable,journals.plos.org,garzette,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.15970955796193,['cacatua goffiniana'],295

Most studies on leucism and other colour aberrations are based on opportunistic observations or small cross-sectional samples, thus limiting our ability to produce reliable results and test theoretical predictions. This study combines cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected in 2016–2020 from a population of red-necked nightjars (Caprimulgus ruficollis). The goals of the study are (i) to investigate sex and age effects on partial leucism, (ii) to separate within-subject effects (progressive greying) from between-subject effects (selective disappearance), and (iii) to examine differences in body mass, structural size, and life span between leucistic and non-leucistic individuals. The probability of leucism in nightjars increased from juveniles to adults at similar rates in males and females. Our longitudinal analysis and life-span comparisons indicated a minor contribution of selective disappearance to age-related changes in leucism, but rather suggested that the loss of melanin from feathers can be attributed to progressive greying in ageing adults. Body mass and size were consistently smaller (5% and 1.5%, respectively) in leucistic than in non-leucistic nightjars, although the reason for this difference remains unclear. Our study sheds light on the sources and mechanisms of variation in leucism in natural populations and its relationship with important life-history traits, such as life span.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07360-8.pdf,nature.com,eared-nightjar,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.16230812513311,['caprimulgus ruficollis'],50

Given that parrot keeping is widespread, in-depth and culturally sensitive research is needed to inform and develop interventions targeted at changing consumer preferences and purchasing behaviours. Parrot keeping is thought to be driven mainly by a desire for companionship (the affection hypothesis). Alternative hypotheses include a deeply ingrained culture of parrot ownership (the tradition hypothesis) or the influence of socio-economic context (the contextual hypothesis). We used the theory of planned behaviour to evaluate the relative importance of behavioural and contextual factors influencing the intention to keep the yellow-shouldered Amazon Amazona barbadensis as a pet. We interviewed 150 owners and non-owners of parrots in two locations in Macanao Peninsula, Margarita Island, Venezuela, where the primary population of this species is located.

Our study expands previous research on the illegal parrot trade by taking into account behavioural measures beyond attitudes, highlighting the role of social norms frequently ignored in such research.

Our results show that although female common cuckoos mimic the call of sparrowhawks imperfectly, they can mislead birds into displaying anti-predatory behavior.

To better understand the possibilities, but also the limitations, we here evaluated data generated in a citizen science project on nightingale song as a case study. We analysed the quantity and quality of song recordings made in a non-standardized way with a smartphone app by citizen scientists and the standardized recordings made with professional equipment by academic researchers. We made comparisons between the recordings of the two approaches and among the user types of the app to gain insights into the temporal recording patterns, the quantity and quality of the data. To compare the deviation of the acoustic parameters in the recordings with smartphones and professional devices from the original song recordings, we conducted a playback test. Our results showed that depending on the user group, citizen scientists produced many to a lot of recordings of valid quality for further bioacoustic research. Differences between the recordings provided by the citizen and the expert group were mainly caused by the technical quality of the devices used—and to a lesser extent by the citizen scientists themselves. Especially when differences in spectral parameters are to be investigated, our results demonstrate that the use of the same high-quality recording devices and calibrated external microphones would most likely improve data quality.

Most of the nations adopted partial or complete ‘lockdown’ and imposed ‘social distancing’ to control the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and its consequence. Though global economic growth declined due to nationwide lockdown, there are certain positive impacts on environment. This review article has discussed the effects of nationwide lockdown aiming to community transmission COVID-19 on animal life behaviour and atmospheric environment in different aspects. In the lockdown period, the levels of NO2 and carbon emission remarkably decrease in atmosphere due to restricted consumption of fossil fuel by industries, thermal power stations and air transportations. The concentration of NO2 dropped by 45–54% in the atmosphere of most populated cities in Europe. The intensities of particulate matters PM2.5 and PM10 decreased by 43% and 31% respectively, at lower atmosphere indicating improvement in air qualities in different parts of world caused by less traffic and construction activities. SPM reduced up to 15.9%, showing improvement in surface water quality. New deserted bank has developed due to less river activities in this period.

Here, we analyzed song pattern variations of 651 Louisiana Waterthrush singers in audio spectrogram recordings obtained from our field work and publicly accessible bioacoustics archives. Visual and auditory assessment of the introductory note sequence of each song identified three distinct song types (A, B, and C) and most of the songs were assigned to one of these types. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest methods were used to verify the assignments and showed strong agreement for Type A with slightly less agreement on Types B and C. User error rates (proportion of the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifications that were incorrect) were low for Types A and B, and somewhat higher for Type C, while producer error rates (proportion of the song type for which the Linear Discriminant Analysis was incorrect) were somewhat higher for Types A and C than the minimal levels achieved for Type B. Our findings confirmed that most between-individual variation was in the number of notes and note sequence duration while most within-individual variation resulted from the percent of downstrokes. The location of each singer was plotted on a map of the breeding range and results suggested the song types have large-scale discrete geographic distributions that co-occur in some regions but not range-wide. Evaluation of the distributions provided tentative support for a hypothesis that two of the song types may independently exhibit congruence with the geographic extent of Pleistocene glacial boundaries and the third song type may be distinguished by a lack of congruence, but further investigation is needed to elucidate whether the song variations represent subpopulations with three separate evolutionary histories.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256385&type=printable,journals.plos.org,parkesia,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-8.178776186832138,"['parkesia motacilla', 'louisiana waterthrush']",231

Here we show that machine learning can nevertheless distinguish the songs from multiple captive zebra finch populations with remarkable precision, and that ‘cryptic song dialects’ predict strong assortative mating in this species. We examine mating patterns across three consecutive generations using captive populations that have evolved in isolation for about 100 generations. We cross-fostered eggs within and between these populations and used an automated barcode tracking system to quantify social interactions. We find that females preferentially pair with males whose song resembles that of the females’ adolescent peers. Our study shows evidence that in zebra finches, a model species for song learning, individuals are sensitive to differences in song that have hitherto remained unnoticed by researchers.

The presence/absence of hybridization between individuals is not directly related to the degree of their evolutionary insularity. Hybridization can result in the origin of new morphs including those that have species status. The application of phylogenetic methods is justified in reconstructing the relation links within complex groups including the morphs of various evolutionary levels (from geographical races to “good” species), the relationships between which are exacerbated by hybridogenous polymorphism and/or the hybridization origins of their populations. Taking into account both new data and new conceptions, we suggest genuine interrelated definitions of concepts such as species, subspecies, and semispecies in birds. The definitions are based on two main criteria: biological, i.e., an evaluation of the reproductive relations of the particular morphs with each other, and phylogenetic, i.e., an evaluation of their evolutionary age and kinship. The main feature of a species as an evolutionary entity should be considered through its stability in time even when its reproductive isolation is periodically broken. Geographic intraspecies races show sustainable variations of different degrees, but they have no reproductive isolation; they breed upon contact and form intergradation zones. They are taxonomically denoted as subspecies. Descriptions of new subspecies are viable to the limits that reflect the species’ natural geographic structure to the fullest extent. For the young morphs that have reached the level of species insularity in the course of evolution, it seems appropriate to restore a semispecies category. Semispecies show significant morphological differences and distinguished ecological particularities, as a rule, but they are connected to closely related morphs by gene flows in contact zones. Distinguishing this category is not regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and, as splitter tendencies prevail in modern systematics, semispecies are more often equated to species; i.e., they have binominal names. We propose to denote the attribution of a semispecies to a particular species group (superspecies) in parentheses between genus and species names. Thus, it would become possible to outline natural complexes and avoid a groundless increase in the taxonomic statuses of morphs in the stage of development. Representatives of distant phylogenetic lines (morphs that separated historically long ago) are not to be considered as semispecies even in the cases of their reproductive isolation being broken and a steady hybridization existing between them.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S1062359020070079.pdf,link.springer.com,penduline-tit,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.18131866041894,,462

Different body morphometrics, hematological and hemoparasitic parameters were quantified on free-living Feral Pigeons in urban environments of northern Algeria. Moreover, plumage melanin-based coloration (MBC) was measured and the data collected at the individual scale was correlated with the previous parameters using linear and non-linear modeling approaches. Plumage MBC scores of the sampled Feral Pigeons ranged between 0.3% and 74.8%. Among the 12 morphological traits measured, body weight, tail length and total length were deemed to be positively correlated with MBC. Darker morphs appeared to have more hemoparasites compared to lighter pigeons. Quite the same observation goes with the immunity but with non-linear trends. The number of monocytes and granulocytes increased with the increase in MBC levels in lighter morphs, while pigeons with high MBC scores exhibited negative relationships between MBC levels and the number of white blood cells. Despite the existence of a number of studies demonstrating phenotypic directional selection, further studies are undoubtedly necessary to understand in detail the underlying mechanisms in species life-history strategies between differently colored individuals.

Playback trials were conducted to explore the levels of response of each taxon to the call types of the other taxa. The territorial call of concinna exhibits a distinct two-element motif, while elegans, maria and virginalis utter a three-element motif in which the first two elements are given in quick succession. On the other hand, vigorsii, produces both two-element and three-element motifs with longer breaks in between elements. As further corroborated by the playback trials, the three taxa elegans, virginalis and maria form a tight vocal cluster, whereas each concinna and vigorsii are distinct. The alarm call turned out to be less diagnostic even though most taxa did roughly separate into different vocal clusters. Morphometric analysis failed to produce strong differences, but plumage distinctions among multiple taxa are pronounced. We suggest splitting the Elegant Pitta into three biological species based on bioacoustic and—less so—plumage evidence: (1) Temminck’s Elegant Pitta P. elegans (including subspecies elegans, virginalis and maria), (2) Wallace’s Elegant Pitta P. concinna (monotypic), and (3) Banda Elegant Pitta P. vigorsii (monotypic).",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00227-4,avianres.biomedcentral.com,buru,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.19174555040958,"['elegant pitta', 'pitta elegans']",539

No man living has devoted more time and toil to the investigation of the Fauna of North-eastern Africa, and as regards the classes of birds and mammals, no man living has a better acquaintance with them. Twelve years passed on the coasts and islands of the Red Sea, in the marshes and jungles of the White Nile, and in the Highlands of Abyssinia, during which time constant attention was devoted to the observation and collection of animals have given Herr von Heuglin unrivalled opportunities for amassing this knowledge, to which his skill as an artist has contributed additional facilities. Soon after returning from his last journey in 1865, Herr von Heuglin planned a general work on the Ornithology of North-eastern Africa to embrace all the notes and observations collected during his different excursions, together with the information acquired by the study of specimens from these countries already existing in the continental museums. In 1869, the first part of the present work was issued, but its large extent hindered its progress, and the author was called away to join the German Expeditions to Nova Zembla and the extreme north, to which he was attached as naturalist. It was not, therefore, until the close of last year, or, we believe we may say until the beginning of the present year, that the concluding part of the Ornithology of North-eastern Africa was issued from the press. Completed, it now forms four volumes, illustrated by fifty-one coloured plates and a map of the region of which it treats, and is by far the most perfect work on the subject hitherto published. Prior to the completion of the present work Rüppell's Atlas, and other publications were, so far as regards Nubia and Abyssinia, the only works of reference, whilst of the district of the White Nile so fully explored by Von Heuglin, very little was known except from fragmentary notices. In the present extended work the ornithology of the whole of these countries, together with that of Egypt, the Red Sea, and Northern Somali-land, are treated of together. The sum of species of birds is thus raised to a high figure, no less than 948, of which upwards of 200 are entirely confined to North-eastern Africa. European species are likewise numerous in these countries, Northern Africa being, as is well known, the favoured haunt of our summer migrants during the winter season. Upwards of 300 European birds thus come to be included in Herr von Heuglin's list. The plan of our author's work is good, though it seems to be rather adapted for the home student than for the field-naturalist, neither family nor generic characters being included. But we observe with pleasure that specific diagnoses are given in Latin to all except the best known species, which, after the contumely that certain imperfectly educated naturalists have recently thought fit to bestow upon that classical tongue, is worthy of all praise. The references to former authors are also numerous, and, so far as we have been able to test them, more accurate than is too often, unfortunately, the case in works of this kind. But the great feature of the book are the observations on the habits and localities extracted from the note-books of the unwearied author. These are much more numerous, and better put together than in almost any other work on foreign ornithology with which we are acquainted. Errors and omissions there are no doubt, and must be, in a work of this magnitude, as indeed is sufficiently evident by the many pages of additions and corrections annexed to the fourth volume, but Herr von Heuglin has spared no trouble to bring his Ornithology of North-eastern Africa up to date, and his volumes will long remain a standard work of reference upon the birds of these districts, which are now attracting so much attention in civilised Europe.",,nature.com,heuglin,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.19497573697431,,1000

Based on our preliminary observations, we hypothesized that component communities of trematodes in T. philomelos in the study area are more diverse and species-rich compared with several decades ago. In the 1961–2019, we performed full-body necropsies of T. philomelos, which originated from the southern Czech Republic, and examined them for the presence of trematodes. We compared the trematode species richness and diversity of the analyzed component communities. The number of trematode species per host steadily increased in time in adult females and males. In juveniles, the highest numbers of trematode species per host were reached already in 1961–1990, then dropped and slowly raised up again in the latter time periods. The newly accumulated evidence suggests that trematodes with intermediate hosts previously restricted to T. philomelos wintering grounds increased in abundance in the study area. Some of them (Morishitium polonicum, Psilotornus confertus) sporadically appeared in juveniles or first-year birds, from which they were previously completely absent. Some of the spreading species, such as Lutztrema attenuatum, are present in high prevalence and high intensities of infection.

Farmers identified several techniques that they use to deter white-faced capuchins, most of which are currently nonlethal.

In this study, we aimed to test the capacity of Southern ground-hornbills (Bucorvus leadbeateri) to show exclusion performance in a two-way object-choice task. First, we determined whether subjects could perceive and choose correctly between two containers (one rewarded, one unrewarded) using visual or acoustic cues (sensory phase).

During the sensory phase, ground-hornbills succeeded in choosing the rewarded container only in the visual modality. Birds were able to select the rewarded container more than would be expected by chance in the Full information condition, but their performances were equal to chance in the Control condition.

Using as an example the controversy over the use of null hypotheses and null models in species co-occurrence studies, I argue that null-model-based hypothesis testing fails to work as a proper analog to traditional statistical null-hypothesis testing as used in well-controlled experimental research, and that the random process hypothesis should not be privileged as a null hypothesis. Instead, the possible use of the null model resides in its role of providing a way to challenge scientists’ commonsense judgments about how a seemingly unusual pattern could have come to be. Despite this possible use, null-model-based hypothesis testing still carries certain limitations, and it should not be regarded as an obligation for biologists who are interested in explaining patterns in nature to first conduct such a test before pursuing their own hypotheses.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10539-020-09748-0.pdf,link.springer.com,cuckoo-dove,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.2297668213098,,727

The study of migratory songbird transition periods, such as the post-breeding period, is complex because birds undertake different types of movements that vary in space and time. Nonetheless, it is important to understand the extent and duration of the territory and specific sites use to identify human activities likely to affect the species’ survival. Individuals from different regional populations may exhibit specific movements during the various phases of their annual cycle, and therefore conservation actions must be adapted. We studied a population of Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis) from the Saguenay region of Quebec, Canada, in the northeastern part of the species’ breeding range. We used a coordinated radio-telemetry network (Motus) to determine the residence time within the breeding territory, dates and times of departure, and early fall migration routes of 18 adult birds. We expected individuals to leave by mid-August and to migrate through the eastern flyway, along the Atlantic Coast. Six tracked individuals remained on their breeding territory until early September, corresponding to a residence time of approximately 90 days. These individuals left just after sunset on their day of departure. Twelve individuals departed earlier, and in the daytime, before the end of August; their earlier departure was likely for a purpose other than migration. Nine individuals were detected outside their breeding territory along the Atlantic migratory flyway: four migrated through the Great Lakes region, one in the Great Appalachian Valley, three along the Atlantic Coast or coastal plain, and one with an undetermined route. Our results suggest that adult Canada Warblers remain in the Saguenay region longer than expected, and that, although some individuals remain close to their breeding territory during the post-breeding period, others may use surrounding territories prior to initiating their fall migration. Our results will allow regional conservation managers to recommend that regional industry postpone the timing of certain activities that could negatively affect the species’ survival. Our study highlights the importance of fine-scale studies focused on specific periods of migratory songbird annual cycles to fill important knowledge gaps for understanding of the ecology of their species.
RÉSUMÉ
L'étude des périodes de transition de passereaux migrateurs, comme la période post-nuptiale, est complexe car les oiseaux entreprennent différents types de déplacements qui varient dans l'espace et le temps. Néanmoins, il est important de comprendre l'étendue et la durée de l'utilisation du territoire et de sites spécifiques pour qu'on puisse déterminer quelles activités humaines sont susceptibles d'affecter la survie de l'espèce. Les individus de différentes populations régionales peuvent présenter des déplacements spécifiques au cours des diverses étapes de leur cycle annuel, et les activités de conservation doivent donc être adaptées. Nous avons étudié une population de Parulines du Canada (Cardellina canadensis) de la région du Saguenay au Québec, Canada, située dans la partie nord-est de l'aire de nidification de l'espèce. Nous avons utilisé un réseau coordonné de radiotélémétrie (Motus) pour déterminer le temps de résidence dans le territoire de nidification, les dates et les heures de départ, et les routes de migration au début de l'automne de 18 oiseaux adultes. Nous nous attendions à ce que les individus quittent à la mi-août et migrent par la voie de migration de l'est, le long de la côte atlantique. Six individus sont restés sur leur territoire de nidification jusqu'à début septembre, soit un temps de résidence d'environ 90 jours. Ces individus ont quitté juste après le coucher du soleil le jour de leur départ. Douze individus sont partis plus tôt, et de jour, avant la fin du mois d'août; leur départ précoce avait sans doute un but autre que la migration. Neuf individus ont été détectés en dehors de leur territoire de nidification le long de la voie de migration de l'Atlantique : quatre ont migré par la région des Grands Lacs, un dans la vallée des Appalaches, trois le long de la côte atlantique ou de la plaine côtière, et un dont nous n'avons pu déterminer l'itinéraire. Nos résultats indiquent que les Parulines du Canada adultes restent dans la région du Saguenay plus longtemps que prévu et que, bien que certains individus restent à proximité de leur territoire de nidification pendant la période postnuptiale, d'autres peuvent utiliser des territoires environnants avant d'entreprendre leur migration automnale. Nos résultats vont permettre aux gestionnaires de la conservation de recommander à l'industrie régionale de reporter le moment d'activités qui pourraient nuire à la survie de l'espèce. Nous soulignons l'importance de mener des études à l'échelle fine visant des périodes spécifiques du cycle annuel des passereaux migrateurs afin de combler les lacunes importantes dans la compréhension de l'écologie de ceux-ci.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art4/ACE-ECO-2021-2013.pdf,ace-eco.org,warbler-finch,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.25542157128449,"['cardellina canadensis', 'ou']",109

Nectar-feeding birds often display behaviour that results in more pollen carryover than insect pollinators, which is predicted to result in frequent outcrossing and high paternal diversity for bird-pollinated plants. We tested this prediction by quantifying mating system parameters and bird visitation in three populations of an understory bird-pollinated herb, Anigozanthos humilis (Haemodoraceae). Microsatellite markers were used to genotype 131 adult plants, and 211 seeds from 23 maternal plants, from three populations. While outcrossing rates were high, estimates of paternal diversity were surprisingly low compared with other bird-pollinated plants. Despite nectar-feeding birds being common at the study sites, visits to A. humilis flowers were infrequent (62 visits over 21,552 recording hours from motion-triggered cameras, or equivalent to one visit per flower every 10 days), and the majority (76%) were by a single species, the western spinebill Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (Meliphagidae). Pollen counts from 30 captured honeyeaters revealed that A. humilis comprised just 0.3% of the total pollen load. For 10 western spinebills, A. humilis pollen comprised only 4.1% of the pollen load, which equated to an average of 3.9 A. humilis pollen grains per bird. Taken together, our findings suggest that low visitation rates and low pollen loads of floral visitors have led to the low paternal diversity observed in this understory bird-pollinated herb. As such, we shed new light on the conditions that can lead to departures from high paternal diversity for plants competing for the pollination services of generalist nectar-feeding birds.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00442-021-04906-x.pdf,link.springer.com,spinebill,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.26291662791648,"['western spinebill', 'acanthorhynchus superciliosus']",367

Many of these represent considerable range extensions. Extant species that were extirpated from the region (e.g., Prolemur simus) are also present. Calibrated radiocarbon ages for 10 bones from extinct primates span the last three millennia. The largely undisturbed taphonomy of bone deposits supports the interpretation that many specimens fell in from a rock ledge above the entrance. Some primates and other mammals may have been prey items of avian predators, but human predation is also evident. Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) suggest that fossils were local to the area. Pottery sherds and bones of extinct and extant vertebrates with cut and chop marks indicate human activity in previous centuries.

While much is known about circulation of zoonotic potential H5N1 and H9N2 AIVs in domestic poultry in Egypt, little is known about the pivotal role of migratory birds in the maintenance and transmission of the viruses in Egypt. Targeted AIV surveillance has been conducted in 2017 in different wetlands areas in Northern and Eastern Egypt. AIV of subtype H5 was detected in two bird species. In addition, a novel reassortant strain of the H6N2 subtype was identified which reveals the continuous risk of new influenza virus(es) introduction into Egypt. This novel virus possesses a reassortant pattern originating from different AIV gene pools.

We found that species with biparental incubation were more likely to have sexually monomorphic tails compared to species with female-only incubation. Furthermore, an analysis of evolutionary pathways suggested interdependent evolution of biparental incubation and sexual tail dimorphism; transitions to biparental incubation and sexual tail dimorphism were less likely to occur than transitions from that state. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection on male ornamentation matters during the incubation period. We also confirmed that species with biparental incubation had significantly lower rates of extra-pair paternity compared to species with female-only incubation in this clade, providing additional support for the importance of selection on male ornamentation during the incubation period.

We explored whether these concepts are useful for understanding the consequences of landscape change. We assessed the literature on surrogate species in relation to landscape change and identified key foci and notable gaps within the existing evidence base. We outlined strengths and limitations of surrogate species as proxies for landscape change. Recent Findings We found that few studies evaluated whether taxa claimed to be surrogate species were in fact robust proxies. This is particularly so for flagship species but is also common in work on umbrella species. We also found marked differences in how the terms and concepts of umbrella, flagship and keystone species were used, both between studies and between disciplines (e.g. forestry versus community ecology). Research into surrogates is often conducted independently of research on landscape change. This leaves a major gap in knowledge about how surrogates can inform decision-making in relation to ongoing threatening processes, including landscape change. Summary Based on results of our literature search and insights from large-scale, long-term empirical studies in south-eastern Australia, we identified a diverse mix of examples where the application of surrogate approaches has been successful, and where it has not. However, it is currently not possible to determine a priori where a given surrogate approach will work. Resolution of this problem requires considerable further work.

In birds, there are numerous examples of species that hybridize with multiple other species. The advent of genomic data provides the opportunity to investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of multispecies hybridization. The interactions between several hybridizing species can be depicted as a network in which the interacting species are connected by edges. Such hybrid networks can be used to identify ‘hub-species’ that interbreed with multiple other species. Avian examples of such ‘hub-species’ are Common Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and European Herring Gull (Larus argentatus). These networks might lead to the formulation of hypotheses, such as which connections are most likely conducive to interspecific gene flow (i.e. introgression). Hybridization does not necessarily result in introgression. Numerous statistical tests are available to infer interspecific gene flow from genetic data and the majority of these tests can be applied in a multispecies setting. Specifically, model-based approaches and phylogenetic networks are promising in the detection and characterization of multispecies introgression. It remains to be determined how common multispecies introgression in birds is and how often this process fuels adaptive changes. Moreover, the impact of multispecies hybridization on the build-up of reproductive isolation and the architecture of genomic landscapes remains elusive.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is an evolutionarily highly conserved peptide hormone. Its regulatory role in cell proliferation and differentiation and its high sensitivity to the nutritional state of individuals suggest it as an interesting candidate, possibly providing a link between body condition and individual capacity to grow elaborated ornamental features. We investigated whether IGF-1 levels during molting correlate with the expression of multiple ornaments in a sexually dichromatic passerine species, the bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus). We collected blood samples of males and females shortly before the molting completed and measured the size and colors of ornamental traits. Our results indicate that in males, structural plumage colors, the size of the melanin-based ornament (beard), and tail length are independent traits. IGF-1 levels are associated with the length of the tail and the expression of male structural plumage components (UV coloration), but not the melanin-based ornament. In females, plumage color and tail length were independent traits, which were not related to IGF-1 levels. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that IGF-1 could play a role in the development of secondary sexual characters in a bird species. Significance statement IGF-1 is an evolutionarily highly conserved peptide hormone, which recently entered the center stage of research enquiry in evolutionary biology. It is considered as one of the key factors shaping individual life histories, but little is known about its effects on sexually selected traits. We investigated whether IGF-1 levels during molting predict the elaboration of multiple ornamental plumage traits in male and female bearded reedlings (Panurus biarmicus). Our results indicate that higher IGF-1 levels had positive effects on male structural plumage colors and tail feather length. This is the first study, bringing indication for a potential role of IGF-1 in the expression of plumage ornaments in a bird species. Our findings suggest that IGF-1 might serve as an ideal candidate to study the mechanisms linking condition and the capacity to develop sexually selected ornaments.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-020-2821-6.pdf,link.springer.com,reedling,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.32231928440934,"['bearded reedling', 'panurus biarmicus']",771

While it is unclear how apparent recognition is achieved, learned associations between the occurrence of the call and the presence of a predator are considered the most likely explanation. Conclusive evidence that this behaviour is indeed underpinned by learning, however, is scarce. This study tested whether wild black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) learn to associate novel sounds with predators through a two-phase field experiment. During an initial training phase, three study groups were each presented with a playback of one of the three novel sounds together with a simulated felid predator on four occasions over an 8- to 12-week period. This was followed by a test phase, wherein each of the three sounds was played back to individuals in all three groups, allowing each sound to serve as both a test stimulus for individuals trained with that sound, and a control stimulus for individuals trained with another sound. Antipredator responses were significantly stronger in response to test sounds than to controls. Limited observations suggest that antipredator responses persisted for at least 2 years without reinforcement of the predator–sound link. Additionally, responses to noisier sounds were typically stronger than were those to more tonal sounds, although the effect of sound type cannot be disentangled from potential effects of group. This study provides the strongest evidence to date that learning affects the responses of primates to sounds such as heterospecific alarm calls, and supports the contention that signals provide receivers with information.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-019-01264-3.pdf,link.springer.com,macuco,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.32307453500014,,1078

We compared the evolution of sound frequency in sexual signals (advertisement songs) and non-sexual social signals (calls) across &gt; 500 genera of the crown songbird families. Contrary to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, we found no evidence that forest species used lower sound frequencies in songs or calls. Consistent with contingent evolution in song, we found lower phylogenetic signal for the sound frequency of songs than calls, which suggests faster and less predictable evolution, and found unpredictable direction of evolution in lineages with longer songs, which presumably experience stronger sexual selection on song. Nonetheless, the most important deterministic pattern of sound frequency evolution—its negative association with body size—was stronger in songs than calls. This can be explained by songs being longer-range signals than most calls, and thus using sound frequencies that animals of a given size produce best at high amplitude.

The Spike-heeled LarkChersomanes albofasciatais a peculiar, short-tailed lark confined to southern, central and East Africa. Typical of resident larks, it exhibits marked geographic variation in plumage colour, which has historically resulted in large numbers of subspecies being described. This variation was examined by sequencing 630 base pairs of the cytochromebgene in 39 individuals and morphometric measurements of 320 birds. Nine of the 14 southern AfricanC. albofasciatasubspecies defined by Clancey in 1980 were sampled for assessing genetic variation, as well as one population from northern Namibia (C. a. boweni) and the isolatedC. [a.] beesleyipopulation in Tanzania. Within South Africa, 16 maternal lineages were identified. The haplotype network revealed three geographically distinct haplogroups: Namaqualand, Karoo and Eastern grasslands, which did not follow past or existing subspecies ranges. Our data thus suggest incongruence between genetic variation and phenotype in South Africa. The boundaries and relationship among the phylogeographic haplogroups and morphometric measurement were similar to the closely related Long-billed LarkCerthilauda curvirostriscomplex suggesting similar processes during their evolutionary history. The existing subspecies designations are clearly not supported by the genetic data presented here and thus more research into this complex is required. Further research should include sampling of Spike-heeled Larks in underrepresented areas of the species’ range and the use of additional genetic markers to improve our understanding of the evolutionary history of this complex.C. [a.] beesleyiwas sister to all haplotypes sampled and smaller in size than all subspecies measured. Although the status of the contentiousC. [a.] beesleyihas still not been resolved, we have added morphometric data supporting its isolation from other subspecies. Its limited and isolated range warrants increased conservation efforts and we propose its recognition as an evolutionarily significant unit.",,nisc.co.za,chersomanes,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-8.342947491287449,,354

Fuller and Johannes Erritzøe, from OBC Bulletin 26, November 1997. The cuckoos are a fascinating group with a cosmopolitan distribution, and exhibit great diversity of form and life history. Owing to their generally secretive nature, many cuckoos are among the least known of the Worlds birds, and the Red-faced Malkoha, Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus, is no exception. The large-billed and boldly patterned malkohas are restricted to the Oriental region, and are represented in Sri Lanka by Blue-faced Malkoha, Phaenicophaeus viridirostris, Sirkeer Malkoha, P. leschenaultii, and Red-faced Malkoha, P. pyrrhocephalus. The former are also found in South India, but even the distributional range of the last remains the subject of controversy. This article aims to provide a summary of current knowledge, indicate the status of current populations and examine possible future trends. Taxonomy The Red-faced Malkoha was described in 1769 by an illustration in Thomas Pennants Indian Zoology as Cuculus pyrrhocephalus. Joan Gideon Loten, who collected the first examples, commissioned Pieter Cornelis de Bevere to paint plates of his living or freshly dead specimens, as methods for the preservation of skins were then poorly developed. Loten loaned these outstanding plates to various zoologists at the time, who described many species from his work. Pennants work can still be found in the library of the British Museum, but there is no trace at that institution of Lotens specimens, also thought to be deposited there. (16,21) This form subsequently became the type of Phaenicophaeus Stephens (Shaws Gen. Zool., 9, pt. 1, 1815, p. 58). The genus has variously been considered to contain up to twelve species, but is now sometimes treated as monotypic, following Peters (17) and later authors but contra Sibley and Monroe.

Legge shot a pair as far north as Trincomalee in about 1870, when 70-80% of the island was covered with forest (Hoffmann in litt. ), but it is probable that the main centre of the range has always been in the wet zone (south-western part of the island) where the main requirement seems to be tall, undisturbed, heavy forest with dense, tangled undergrowth. It is rarely seen near cultivation.20 Remaining isolated populations within the dry zone (north and east Sri Lanka) are found exclusively in riverine forests such as Wasgomuwa National Park, along the Heen Ganga, and Kumbukkan Oya, Menik Ganga and at Lahugala. (10) It is probably rarer in the dry zone than in the wet zone. There is great vertical utilisation of the forest. Most reports indicate that it prefers the foliage canopy of trees and shrubs, but it also descends almost to the ground especially where the understorey is thick (Warakagoda, in litt. ). It is said by Fisher et al. 6 to favour undergrowth, and indeed may breed at lower levels within the forest.",,orientalbirdclub.org,racket-tail,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.3436089473184,"['ganga', 'phaenicophaeus viridirostris', 'sirkeer malkoha', 'phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus']",1000

Yet, especially in gregarious species, ornaments can also have non-sexual social functions, raising the possibility that observed sex differences in ornamentation are plastic. For example, females may invest in costly ornamentation more plastically, to protect body and reproductive ability in more adverse ecological conditions. We tested this hypothesis with experimental work on the mutually-ornamented common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), supplementing their diets either with pigmentary (lutein, a carotenoid) or non-pigmentary (vitamin E) antioxidants, or alleviating winter cold temperature. We found that both lutein and vitamin E supplementation increased red bill colour saturation in females, reaching the same mean saturation as males, which supports the hypothesis that female bill colour is more sensitive to environmental or physiological conditions. The effect of vitamin E, a non-pigment antioxidant, suggests that carotenoids were released from their antioxidant functions. Alleviating winter cold did not increase bill colour saturation in either sex, but increased the stability of female bill colour over time, suggesting that female investment in bill colour is sensitive to cold-mediated stress. Together, results show that waxbill bill sexual dichromatism is not stable. Instead, sexual dichromatism can be modulated, and even disappear completely, due to ecology-mediated plastic adjustments in female bill colour.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93897-z.pdf,nature.com,waxbill,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.34882907336721,"['estrilda astrild', 'common waxbill']",272

In January 1968, during the course of ringing activities at a wetland site in south-central Thailand, fieldworkers discovered a strange swallow amongst large numbers of migrant hirundines. It proved to be a new species and was christened the White-eyed River-Martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae by Kitti Thonglongya who dedicated this spectacular and beautiful bird to Princess Sirindhorn Thepratanasuda. Over the next three years several more specimens were collected at the same site, but apart from these, and a fleeting observation in 1978, this remarkable bird has effectively vanished. An avian enigma, it has come to epitomise the mythical allure of rarity to the birdwatcher, and for three decades it has symbolised the Asian mystery of the ornithological world. As such it has appeared in logo form in the pages of this journal as the archetypal little-known bird. The time has come to compile our knowledge of the species and to present it afresh in the hope that it might lead to a dramatic rediscovery. To begin with, we need to retrace the events of January and February 1968 and glean what we can from the available facts. The site of discovery is first misleadingly given as a big marsh on the Chao Praya River (1). The type-locality is then specified as Bung (= Nong = Lake) Boraphet, Amphoe Muang, Nakhon Sawan Province, central Thailand (1), and from its subsequent description as a shallow, marshy, reed-filled lake of 25,000 hectares it seems clear that this is the big marsh originally mentioned (a point confirmed by Thonglongya (2)). Rediscovery efforts in 1980-1981 were apparently concentrated on an island where all of Kitti's river martins had been captured (3), suggesting that, at one time, confidence was high that a very precise origin was known. White-eyed River-Martin © H.E. McClure This no longer appears to be the case. The first White-eyed River-Martins were reportedly caught while night-trapping roosting swallows (Hirundo rustica, H. daurica, Riparia riparia), wagtails and warblers by casting a fishing net over a reedbed (1) a method repeated by subsequent authors (3,4,5). However, according to a local technician who worked with the original field team, the birds were neither seen in the field nor trapped by any of the team members, but rather were brought in to the teams hotel in nearby Nakhon Sawan by villagers following a broadcast appeal for live wild birds for ringing purposes (6). It seems likely, therefore, that the precise site of collection is impossible to determine, but that it is certainly in the region of Bung Boraphet, and most likely at the lake itself. Whatever their exact origins, nine specimens were initially collected: one each on 28 and 29 January (although the label on specimen 53-1218 actually states 27 January 1968 (6)) and seven on 10 February 1968 (1).

Mammals were the greatest detected prey class with Plateau Pika (Ochotona curzoniae) being the most frequent.",en,Use of DNA metabarcoding of bird pellets in understanding raptor diet on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China,"Abstract 
Background: Diet analysis is essential to understanding the functional role of large bird species in food webs. Mor-
phological analysis of regurgitated bird pellet contents is time intensive and may underestimate biodiversity. DNA 
metabarcoding has the ability to circumvent these issues, but has yet to be done.
Methods: We present a pilot study using DNA metabarcoding of MT-RNR1 and MT-CO1 markers to determine the 
species of origin and prey of 45 pellets collected in Qinghai and Gansu Provinces, China.
Results: We detected four raptor species [Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo), Saker Falcon (Falco cherrug), Steppe Eagle 
(Aquila nipalensis), and Upland Buzzard (Buteo hemilasius)] and 11 unique prey species across 10 families and 4 classes. 
Mammals were the greatest detected prey class with Plateau Pika (Ochotona curzoniae) being the most frequent. 
Observed Shannon’s and Simpson’s diversity for Upland Buzzard were 1.089 and 0.479, respectively, while expected 
values were 1.312 ± 0.266 and 0.485 ± 0.086. For Eurasian Eagle Owl, observed values were 1.202 and 0.565, while 
expected values were 1.502 ± 0.340 and 0.580 ± 0.114. Interspecific dietary niche partitioning between the two spe-
cies was not detected.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate successful use of DNA metabarcoding for understanding diet via a novel 
noninvasive sample type to identify common and uncommon species. More work is needed to understand how 
raptor diets vary locally, and the mechanisms that enable exploitation of similar dietary resources. This approach has 
wide ranging applicability to other birds of prey, and demonstrates the power of using DNA metabarcoding to study 
species noninvasively.

Two bird species, a corvid (New Caledonian crow) and a parrot (African grey parrot), have demonstrated the ability to use mirrors instrumentally in mirror-mediated spatial locating tasks. However, they have not been challenged with a mirror-guided reaching task, which involves a more complex understanding of the mirror’s properties. In the present study, a task approximating the mirror-guided reaching task used in primate studies was adapted for, and given to, a corvid species (Eurasian jay) using a horizontal string-pulling paradigm. Four birds learned to pull the correct string to retrieve a food reward when they could see the food directly, whereas none used the reflected information to accomplish the same objective. Based on these results, it cannot be concluded whether these birds understand the correspondence between the location of the reward and its reflected information, or if the relative lack of visual-perceptual motor feedback given by the setup interfered with their performance. This novel task is posited to be conceptually more difficult compared to mirror-mediated spatial locating tasks, and should be used in avian species that have previously been successful at using the mirror instrumentally. This would establish whether these species can still succeed at it, and thus whether the task does indeed pose additional cognitive demands.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-021-01590-5.pdf,link.springer.com,jay,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.37210933212869,"['eurasian jay', 'african grey parrot', 'new caledonian crow']",125

Thus, predator recognition provides a useful tool for the investigation of the process of discrimination and categorization in non-trained animals. The most important role in this process is usually attributed to the prominent unique features shared by all members within the wider category of predators (sharp teeth or beaks, claws, talons and conspicuous eyes). However, birds are also able to discriminate between particular predator species according to their species-specific features (based mainly on colouration). We manipulated general raptor salient features (hooked beak, talons with claws and eyes with supraorbital ridges) and/or species-specific plumage colouration on the dummy of a Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) to investigate their importance in the recognition process of the red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio) during nest defence. We showed that the presence of general raptor salient features is necessary for the recognition of a predator. The kestrel dummy with natural species-specific colouration with altered raptor salient features was treated by shrikes as a harmless bird.

The chiffchaff is among such species. Several allopatric and parapatric forms inhabit the space of its trans-Palaearctic range. They vary in body size and vocalization, and, in accordance with the plumage color, they can be divided into two groups: “greenish” and “brownish.” We made a comparative analysis of the song of three allopatric “brownish” forms (lorenzii, sindianus, and tristis), as well as one “greenish” form (caucasicus), which is sympatric with lorenzii (the only case of almost complete sympatry of different forms of chiffchaff). Significant differences were found in a number of phonetic and syntactic song parameters. Complete separation of the forms studied can be made according to the maximum frequency of the song and the speed of its performance (the number of notes per second). The sindianus form stands out for its relatively high-frequency and broadband song. The tristis form shows the lowest frequency song and the narrowest range. It is also the leader in the speed of performance of the song (up to 6–7 notes/s). The number of notes with a rising modulation is the maximum in tristis and the minimum in lorenzii; no such notes exist in caucasicus, like in other “greenish” chiffchaffs.

Walking down from the dismantled Anaso logging camp on the western slopes of Mount Rorekatimbu towards the Palu-Napu main road bisecting the Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi around dusk on 18 July 1998, I was truly startled by an unidentified flying object nearly colliding with me. Probably as shocked as I was, it hovered for a few seconds at breast height less than half a meter in front of me whilst repeatedly uttering a distinctive tchor and subsequently perched nearby at eye-height on top of low roadside ginger thickets, soon revealing itself as a medium-sized nightjar Caprimulgus species. Fortunately this bird remained happily in the torch beam for about five minutes as I gradually approached it down to point-blank range and I had little hesitation in identifying it as a female Heinrich's Nightjar Eurostopodus diabolicus, one of Sulawesi's most enigmatic and sought-after endemic bird species (overview in Birdlife International (2)). Heinrich’s Nightjar © Jimmy Chew On 23 July I revisited the site, which is situated at about 1,900 m elevation, accompanied by Bernard and Erika Van Eleghem-Winne, who had received a sound recording of E. diabolicus secured by Mark Van Beirs also at Anaso during a Birdquest the previous year, de facto perhaps the first definite contemporary record of the species (see below). Most likely the territorial male belonging to the previously spotted female, responded dramatically for a short period around dusk by flying several times low overhead and calling back regularly. Between 15 and 18 December 1998 together with Raf Drijvers I taped out a pair on three occasions around the former Anaso clearing at about 2,000 m elevation and further located two different pairs along the main road at an altitude of about 1,750 m near Lake Tambing.(1,2) With the exception of the Anaso pair, which perched briefly though rather distantly, the birds were mostly seen in flight, however they allowed for their vocalisations to be sound recorded. On 13 July 2000 I heard and briefly saw what was undoubtedly Heinrich's Nightjar in ridgetop lower montane forest at 1,650 m within the Gunung Ambang Nature Reserve, Bolaang Mongondow, North Sulawesi. Great Eared Nightjar Eurostopodus macrotis constitutes the prime confusion species and numerous unsubstantiated claims of Heinrich's Nightjar persist, originating from the fact that few observers seem to realise that the subspecies macropterus endemic to Sulawesi is strikingly different from the huge harrier-like E. m. cerviniceps of mainland South-East Asia that they have usually become acquainted with previously. It definitely remains odd that many observers claiming diabolicus actually do not see Great Eared Nightjar at all on Sulawesi despite the latter's generally much greater relative abundance. Coates and Bishop(3) briefly summarised the main distinguishing features of Heinrich's Nightjar and the species' identification has been thoroughly elucidated by Cleere and Nurney.(4) In contrast, Bishop and Diamond5 incomprehensibly perpetuate some of the previously reigning misconceptions by talking about a much larger E. m. macrotis with harrier-like flight when discussing differences with diabolicus. Only the unique female type specimen of Heinrich's Nightjar exists and there are slight discrepancies in available published measurements. Based on those provided by Cleere and Nurney4 and under the assumption that sexual biometric differentiation within diabolicus is marginal, as in the closely allied Archbold's Nightjar Eurostopodus archboldi of montane New Guinea (see below), estimated size disparity between the two forms could be up to about 20% in total body length, 26% in wing length and about 20% in tail length. Naturally, some caution is appropriate given that only the holotype is available for analysis and in other members of Eurostopodus the male is known to be the larger sex, in which case the discrepancies may be even further reduced slightly. Nonetheless figures above are consistent with my personal live perception of both taxa and although substantial, to the inexperienced observer such differences may, however, not always be easy to assess correctly in the field, especially in the dim light conditions that characterise many nightjar sightings.",,orientalbirdclub.org,eared-nightjar,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.38244882641189,"['eurostopodus diabolicus', 'eurostopodus archboldi', 'great eared nightjar', 'nightjar', 'eurostopodus macrotis']",1000

In a nature reserve, the foraging sites of waterbirds are relatively fixed, but frequently close to residential areas and can also be visited by domestic fowls. It is easy to result in the trans-species-flock dispersal of gut microbes between the wild birds and domestic fowls. The effects of the variable foraging site distances on the gut microbe structures of the waterbirds and the sympatric domestic fowls are currently unclear, and further research is required to evaluate the impacts of geographic location on cross-infection. Illumina high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis software were utilized to compare and analyze the composition of gut microbes from the fecal samples of Hooded Cranes (HC; Grus monacha) and two groups of Domestic Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) that foraged at 1 km (ducks in near areas, D-N), and 4 km (ducks in far areas, D-F) away from the habitats of the Hooded Cranes at Shengjin Lake, China. The results showed that there were significant differences in the alpha-diversity of the gut bacteria in the HC, D-N, and D-F samples under the interspecific distance factor. The dominant bacterial phyla, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, showed correlations with distance for each host. The D-N group had more diverse intestinal flora than the D-F, as they were physically closer to the HC and had more indirect contact and cross-transmission of their gut microbes. More potentially pathogenic bacterial sequences, and Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were found in the D-N than in HC and D-F. Hooded Cranes and the Domestic Duck populations at variable distances from the cranes showed significant differences in their intestinal bacteria and potentially pathogenic bacteria. The closer the foraging sites were, the easier the intestinal flora spread across species.

Small flocks of molting pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) near sea ice and incubating common ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) in the Arctic environment were chosen for the RGB and thermal image studies. From the acquired images, we built mosaicked RGB images and coregistered thermal images, and estimated the animal shapes. Our results showed that geese were discriminated in both RGB and thermal images with water and sea ice backgrounds. Incubating plover bodies were not distinguished in RGB images due to their cryptic coloration, but they were detected in thermal images with cold background areas in the Arctic environment. We further conducted a blind survey in a restricted area under military control in Korea near the breeding sites of black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), which is an endangered species. From UAV flights with RGB and thermal cameras operated out of the restricted area, we acquired images of white objects in the mudflats and verified that the objects were resting spoonbills by watching the birds. We suggest that thermal cameras and UAVs can be applied to monitor animals in extreme environments and in restricted areas and help researchers find cryptic wader nests.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222088&type=printable,journals.plos.org,rheinard,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.39722979256058,"['spoonbill', 'anser brachyrhynchus', 'platalea minor', 'charadrius hiaticula']",959

On the contrary, the speciation with gene flow model supposes that gene flow does occur during the speciation process. Whether allopatric species have gene flow during the speciation process is still an open question. We used the genetic information from 31 loci of 24 Chinese Bamboo Partridges (Bambusicola thoracicus) and 23 Taiwan Bamboo Partridges (B. sonorivox) to infer the gene flow model of the two species, using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) model. The ecological niche model was used to infer the paleo-distribution during the glacial period. We also tested whether the two species had a conserved ecological niche by means of a background similarity test. The genetic data suggested that the post-divergence gene flow between the two species was terminated before the mid-Pleistocene. Furthermore, our ecological niche modeling suggested that their ecological niches were highly conserved, and that they shared an overlapping potential distribution range in the last glacial maximum.

In humans, the infection can progress to a severe disease with high fatality, raising public health concerns due to the limited prophylactic and therapeutic options available. Animal species, clinically unaffected by the virus, serve as viral reservoirs and amplifier hosts, and can be a valuable tool for surveillance. Little is known about the occurrence and prevalence of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) in Cameroon. Knowledge on CCHFV exposure and the factors associated with its presence in sentinel species are a valuable resource to better understand transmission dynamics and assess local risks for zoonotic disease emergence.   Methods and findings We conducted a CCHFV serological survey and risk factor analysis for animal level seropositivity in pastoral and dairy cattle in the North West Region (NWR) and the Vina Division (VD) of the Adamawa Region in Cameroon. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for sampling design-effects and test performance. In addition, explanatory multivariable logistic regression mixed-effects models were fit to estimate the effect of animal characteristics, husbandry practices, risk contacts and ecological features on the serological status of pastoral cattle. The overall seroprevalence was 56.0% (95% CI 53.5–58.6) and 6.7% (95% CI 2.6–16.1) among pastoral and dairy cattle, respectively. Animals going on transhumance had twice the odds of being seropositive (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.8), indicating that animal movements could be implicated in disease expansion. From an ecological perspective, absolute humidity (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.9) and shrub density (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4–3.2) were associated with seropositivity, which suggests an underlying viral dynamic connecting vertebrate host and ticks in a complex transmission network.   Conclusions This study demonstrated high seroprevalence levels of CCHFV antibodies in cattle in Cameroon indicating a potential risk to human populations. However, current understanding of the underlying dynamics of CCHFV locally and the real risk for human populations is incomplete. Further studies designed using a One Health approach are required to improve local knowledge of the disease, host interactions and environmental risk factors. This information is crucial to better project the risks for human populations located in CCHFV-suitable ecological niches.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010217&type=printable,journals.plos.org,niam-niam,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.42006548345001,,30

Seabirds, being long-lived top-level marine predators, are often considered to be valuable environmental indicators. With growing evidence of seabird declines worldwide, it is essential to monitor changes in populations and determine drivers of change. The Seychelles Archipelago supports the greatest abundance of seabirds in the tropical Indian Ocean, but regional seabird population breeding success and trend data are not readily available despite multi-year data collection at several locations. Here we use monitoring data on White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) in the Seychelles to present the first nation-wide assessment of the status and trends of breeding success at five key sites. Mean annual breeding success was 15% for Aldabra Atoll in the southern Seychelles and 33–55% in the inner islands (Aride, Cousine, Denis, and Cousin). In the inner islands there are indications of potential population declines (inferred from declining nesting activity rates at Aride), despite stable and comparatively high breeding success. This contrasts with Aldabra where nesting activity has been relatively stable, but a decline in breeding success is causing concern. Our study highlights clear priorities for management ofP. lepturuspopulations in the Seychelles; the causes of the declines inP. lepturusbreeding population at Aride and breeding success at Aldabra should be a focus of future research and monitoring. We propose the adoption of standardized monitoring programs and increased site coverage across the Seychelles and the broader Western Indian Ocean. This, coupled with increased pooling of data and regular analysis, will strengthen the collective effort toward the conservation management of this and other seabird species within this global seabird hotspot.
RESUME_
Les oiseaux marins, prédateurs de haut niveau trophique et de longue durée de vie, sont souvent considérés comme de précieux indicateurs environnementaux. Compte tenu de l'accumulation d'indications penchant vers la diminution des oiseaux marins dans le monde entier, il est essentiel de surveiller les changements dans les populations et de déterminer leurs facteurs sous-jacents. L'archipel des Seychelles abrite la plus grande abondance d'oiseaux marins de l'océan Indien tropical, mais il y a peu de données régionales sur le succès de reproduction et la tendance des populations d'oiseaux marins malgré la collecte de données pluriannuelles à plusieurs endroits. Dans le présent article, nous avons utilisé les données de suivis des Phaétons à bec jaune (Phaethon lepturus) aux Seychelles pour présenter la première évaluation à l'échelle nationale du statut et de la tendance du succès de reproduction à cinq sites clés. Le succès annuel moyen de reproduction était de 15 % pour l'atoll d'Aldabra dans le sud des Seychelles et de 33-55 % dans les îles intérieures (Aride, Cousine, Denis et Cousin). Dans les îles intérieures, des indications laissent entrevoir une baisse potentielle de la population (déduite de la baisse du taux d'activité de nidification à Aride), malgré un succès de reproduction stable et comparativement élevé. Ce résultat contraste avec Aldabra, où l'activité de nidification a été relativement stable, mais où la baisse du succès de reproduction est préoccupante. Notre étude révèle des priorités claires pour la gestion des populations de P. lepturus aux Seychelles; les causes de la baisse de la population nicheuse de P. lepturus à Aride et du succès de reproduction à Aldabra devraient faire l'objet de recherches et de suivis. Nous préconisons l'adoption de programmes de suivis normalisés et une couverture accrue de sites aux Seychelles et dans l'ensemble de l'océan Indien occidental. Cette proposition, associée à une mise en commun accrue des données et à leur analyse régulière, renforcera l'effort collectif pour la gestion de la conservation de cette espèce et d'autres espèces d'oiseaux marins dans ce lieu d'intérêt mondial pour les oiseaux marins.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art28/ACE-ECO-2021-1858.pdf,ace-eco.org,équatorial,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.43620975722518,['phaethon lepturus'],140

Rasmussen, from OBC Bulletin 27, June 1998. This bird was not discriminated by me, but three specimens were included among those of 'brama' sent to Mr Hume. From the dates of the specimens I remember very distinctly about them. All were shot in the heavy jungle below the Satpuras, and all were shot late in the morning sitting alone on the tops of thin trees. This being such an extraordinary position for 'brama'. I shot the birds to make sure, but not having specimens of 'brama' to compare them with, stupidly took for granted they were only, brama. They are not uncommon in this dense jungle, and I have repeatedly seen others sitting on exposed trees. I do not think they are found in the Akrani [hills] or higher Satpuras, as I have never seen any Owl of the 'brama' type there. (1) Until November 1997, the above was nearly all that was known about the Forest Owlet, Athene blewitti. James Davidson, an official stationed in Western Khandesh, had assembled the sole collection of birds from north of the Tapti River between Taloda and Shirpur, which happened to include the first three Forest Owlet specimens from western India. Only two other specimens had ever been collected, far to the east. None of the three collectors Davidson, Blewitt and Ball were professional ornithologists, and Davidson seemed a self-taught bird preparator, inventing odd techniques no one else used. After 1884, many years elapsed without any records of Athene blewitti. Whistler and Ticehurst, despite their comprehensive coverage of most Indian species in the monograph they were preparing, had only included one short reference on the species before their untimely deaths in the early 1940s (2). In 1952, S. Dillon Ripley wrote, the fact that no new information has come to light... is not evidence that the owlet is extinct (3). And then, sometime after the 1961 publication of the, Synopsis (4), Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen informed Dr Salim Ali and Ripley that he had taken one at Mandvi, Gujarat, in 1914. This record appeared to extend the range of the Forest Owlet right across the top of the Indian peninsula. Forest Owlet (Larry B. McQueen) In 1974 Ripley and Ali began seriously laying plans to search for the owlet (5) and in the next two years they worked in forests along the Mahanadi River about 50 miles east of the type locality; at Melghat (6); and briefly in the Shahada Forest Division about 80 miles north of Dhulia, finding there that most of the area around the hills as well as along the river was completely devoid of any original forest (7). That April, Ripley sent S. A. Hussain to Meinertzhagen's locality, which was apparently once heavily forested, but there was no trace of this forest now except for a small undulating terrain of thin forest surrounded by cultivation (8). All these efforts met with the same result: no sign of the Forest Owlet. Following this, several authors considered the species extinct. Not until Nigel Collar of BirdLife International and I discovered that Meinertzhagen's specimen was actually Davidson's fifth specimen, now remade and relabelled with false data, did we look further into the status of the Forest Owlet, when it gradually became evident that none of the four genuine sites had been searched!",,orientalbirdclub.org,whistler,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.44090002246069,"['athene blewitti', 'forest owlet']",1000

The aim of this study was to assess the potential of a melanin-based plumage ornament (brown hood) to reflect components of individual quality (condition and physiological stress) in a common larid species, the Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus. For this purpose, we measured the size of the hood in over 500 Black-headed Gulls captured in several breeding colonies distributed across Poland. We found that hood size correlated positively with blood haemoglobin concentration, although we found no evidence for a relationship with blood glucose concentration or body mass. There was also a negative relationship between hood size and physiological stress, as assessed by leucocyte profiles (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio). We found this correlation in both sexes, suggesting that hood size may be an honest signal of individual quality in males and females, which implies a mutual mate choice in the Black-headed Gull. Finally, the relationship between hood size and blood haemoglobin concentration was primarily attributed to the parallel variation of these traits among the colonies, suggesting that Black-headed Gulls may settle in colonies in a despotic manner. As far as we are aware, our study is one of the first to show an honest signalling role of melanin-based ornaments in the gull family, Laridae.

The overall plumage pattern of the hybrid individual recorded in the field was similar to that of the Rufous Motmot, except for the following features, which appear to have been inherited from the Amazonian Motmot: two narrow blue lines in the facial mask; distinct blue feathers on the pectoral spot; and central rectrices with terminal racquets. Among the database photos examined, we found a second possible hybrid, with the same diagnostic features present in the hybrid recorded in the field. Similarities in behavior and vocalizations, in addition to the scarcity of mates in the limits of the distributions of Amazonian and Rufous Motmots, may explain the occurrence of hybrids between them.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43388-020-00002-5.pdf,link.springer.com,motmot,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.45302677998402,"['baryphthengus martii', 'rufous motmot', 'momotus momota', 'amazonian motmot']",671

A migratory population of the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is reintroduced in Europe, in course of a LIFE + project. Since 2014, all individuals have been equipped with GPS-devices. Remote monitoring allows the implementation of focussed measures against major mortality causes. Initially all birds carried battery-powered devices, fixed on the lower back of the birds. Since 2016 an increasing amount of birds has been equipped with solar-powered devices, fixed on the upper back, the more sun-exposed position. In 2016, we observed opacity in the cornea of one eye (unilateral corneal opacity; UCO) during a regular health monitoring for the first time. By 2018, a total of 25 birds were affected by UCO, with varying intensity up to blindness. Clinical examination of the birds revealed no clear cause for the symptoms. However, only birds carrying a device on the upper back were affected (2017 up to 70% of this group). In contrast, none of the birds carrying devices on the lower back ever showed UCO symptoms. This unexpected relationship between tagging and UCO was discovered in 2017. After we took countermeasures by removing the device or repositioning it on the lower back, we observed an immediate reduction of the incidence rate without any new cases reported since January 2019. NBI roost with their head on the back, one eye closely placed to the device if it was positioned on the upper back. Thus, we conclude that the most parsimonious explanation for the symptomatology is either a repetitive slight temperature rise in the corneal tissue due to electromagnetic radiation by the GSM module of the device or a repetitive slight mechanical irritation of the corneal surface. Concrete evidence is missing so far. Meanwhile, cases of UCO were found in another NBI population. Our observations indicate that further research in the fast-growing field of biologging is urgently needed. The findings question the positioning of devices on the upper back in birds roosting with the head on the back.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00223-8,avianres.biomedcentral.com,rheinard,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.45310435262988,"['northern bald ibis', 'geronticus eremita']",551

Here we use phylogenetic comparative techniques to show that mammal vocal characteristics and hearing sensitivity have co-evolved to utilise higher frequencies in forest environments – opposite to the general prediction that lower frequencies should be favoured in acoustically cluttered habitats. We also reveal an evolutionary trade-off between high frequency hearing sensitivity and the production of calls with high frequency acoustic energy that suggests forest mammals further optimise vocal communication according to their high frequency hearing sensitivity. Our results provide clear evidence of adaptive signal and sensory system coevolution. They also emphasize how constraints imposed by the signalling environment can jointly shape vocal signal structure and auditory systems, potentially driving acoustic diversity and reproductive isolation. Sensory drive theory predicts that vocal signalling coevolves with auditory sensitivity, but empirical evidence is limited.

They provide nutritional and aseasonal fruit crops that are consumed by many frugivores, often in times of fruit scarcity. In a mutually beneficial relationship, the plants also benefit from seed dispersal by birds and mammals away from the parent plants enhancing germination and plant recruitment. Here, we assessed the effect of ingestion of Ficus fruit by avian frugivores, compared with manually de-pulped fruit and whole fruits, on seedling emergence and cumulative germination of three Ficus spp. (F. sur, F. lutea and F. natalensis). Fruits of Ficus spp. were fed to Dark-capped Bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor, Knysna Turacos Tauraco corythaix, Purple-crested Turaco Gallirex porphyreolophus, Red-winged Starlings Onychognathus morio, Speckled Mousebirds Colius striatus and invasive Rose-ringed Parakeets Psittacula krameri. We recorded seed retention time as the time from the ingestion of seeds to the first appearance when excreted by the birds. Seeds removed from excreta, manually de-pulped seeds, and whole fruit were planted concurrently in soil trays in a greenhouse. Seedling emergence was recorded daily, and the proportion of seed germinated was calculated as germination success. Germination success of avian ingested seeds increased significantly compared with seeds in whole fruit and manually de-pulped seeds, except seed germination for F. sur seeds ingested by Dark-capped Bulbuls. Ingested seeds germinated the fastest, followed by seeds in whole fruits and lastly, de-pulped seeds. Ficus sur and F. lutea ingested seeds had higher germination percentages than F. natalensis. Our results showed that ingestion by birds typically improved Ficus seed germination as well as the additional positive effects of seed movement such as long-distance seed dispersal. These findings have important implications with the potential to improve Ficus seed dispersal, promote regeneration and sustain populations of the many vertebrates that depend on fig fruit.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-022-01963-8.pdf,link.springer.com,knysna,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.45702698291435,"['tauraco corythaix', 'onychognathus morio', 'pycnonotus tricolor', 'gallirex porphyreolophus', 'colius striatus', 'psittacula krameri']",78

The requirements for amino acids are well documented for domestic bird species but are largely unknown for wild birds, which makes it impossible to reliably assess the nutritional adequacy of foods eaten by wild birds. We measured the maintenance requirements for three essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, and arginine) in two species of songbird, the omnivorous Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus) and granivorous White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). Hermit Thrushes and White-throated Sparrows had similar requirements for lysine (20.02 and 19.95 mg/day, respectively) and methionine (12.3 and 10.85 mg/day, respectively), whereas thrushes had lower requirements for arginine (18.07 mg/day) compared to sparrows (34.5 mg/day). Consistent with previous studies, most birds fed diets with inadequate essential amino acid concentrations reduced food intake and fecal output, lost body mass, and had lower, but not negative nitrogen balance. However, we provide the first evidence that songbirds overcompensate when they consume diets very deficient in lysine. Available data on amino acid concentrations in natural foods suggests that most insects contain relatively high concentrations of all essential amino acids, seeds likely satisfy requirements of lysine and arginine but not methionine for Hermit Thrushes and White-throated Sparrows, whereas fruits generally contain inadequate amounts of all essential amino acids. Therefore, birds that eat mostly fruit may consume enough protein but likely must eat other types of foods to satisfy their essential amino acid requirements.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01915-8.pdf,link.springer.com,decken,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-8.46551429676301,"['hermit thrush', 'catharus guttatus', 'zonotrichia albicollis']",268

Typically, it depends on a number of specific and often complex spatial relations and there are thus very few reported cases in non-human animals (e.g., specific nut-cracking techniques in chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys). The innovative strategies underlying the innovation and spread of tool manufacture and associative tool use (using &gt; 1 tools) across tool using animals is an important milestone towards a better understanding of the evolution of human technology. We tested Goffin’s cockatoos on a composite tool problem, the ‘Golf Club Task’, that requires the use of two objects in combination (one used to control the free movement of a second) to get a reward. We demonstrate that these parrots can innovate composite tool use by actively controlling the position of the end effector and movement of both objects involved in a goal directed manner. The consistent use of different techniques by different subjects highlights the innovative nature of the individual solutions.

Schernakow describes very fully, from his own journeys in Manchuria and from the contributions of other writers, various aspects of the extensive fur-trade. The majority of the fur-bearing animals are captured by means of snares, traps, pits, as well as by firearms and poison, but sometimes hunting dogs and birds of prey are employed, and one of the illustrations actually shows a hunter in the Barga using bow and arrow. The furs are collected locally, and ultimately most find their way to the fur-market at Harbin. Here in the season 1937–38, 1,217,169 furs were sold, an increase of more than a quarter million oversales of the previous year. The greater number represents five relatively common species: Tolai hare (Lepus tolai) 500,000; rat (Rattus norvegicus caraco) 200,000; Sansing squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris mantchuricus) and yellow ermine (Mustela alpina raddei) 100,000 each; and kolinsky (Mustela sibirica of various subspecies) 130,000.

Here I summarise the insights from 30 years of research on shorebird biology to illustrate the contributions of these to four research fields: breeding system evolution, sex ratio research, speciation and biodiversity conservation. Two major conclusions can be drawn from these insights. First, as shorebirds live in a variety of habitats and exhibit puzzling adaptations to their environments, studying their ecology, behaviour and life histories provides novel insights into the emergence and maintenance of organismal diversity. Second, to uncover patterns and processes in evolution, it is both important and stimulating to combine different research methods, and detailed single-species studies with multi-species comparative approach. My main thesis is that curiosity-driven research into the natural history of non-conventional model organisms provides novel insights into fundamental processes in ecology, behaviour and evolution.

Geometric morphometrics and analyses of traditional measurements yielded new information about the Rodrigues owl’s evolution and ecology. Otus murivorus exhibits a 2-tier “lag behind” phenomenon for cranium and brain evolution, both being proportionately small relative to increased body size. It also had a much more developed olfactory bulb than congeners, indicating an unexpectedly developed olfactory sense, suggesting a partial food scavenging habit. In addition, O. murivorus had the eyes placed more laterally than O. sunia, the species from which it was derived, probably a side effect of a small brain; rather terrestrial habits; probably relatively fearless behavior; and a less vertical posture (head less upright) than other owls (this in part an allometric effect of size increase).

It publishes original papers in the English language concerning all aspects of ornithology (e.g. behavioural biology, life history, distribution, taxonomy, nomenclature, ecology and conservation) in the Oriental and Eastern Palaearctic regions. Geographical coverage extends to Lydekker’s Line in the east (including the Moluccas, Kai and Tanimbar) and to Pakistan in the west. In the Indian Ocean, the western and southern limits are the Maldives and Christmas Island. In the Pacific Ocean, the Commanders, Japan and all its associated island possessions and the Philippines are included. In Russia, the western boundary of the region is roughly between 80° and 90°E. The Journal of Asian Ornithology invites the submission of research articles containing original data and novel insights. Reviews and short communications may also be considered, but authors should consult with editors about their suitability prior to submission. Examples of eligible submissions include the distribution and ecology of birds, taxonomic discoveries, descriptions and revisions, and novel aspects of avian behaviour (e.g. nesting biology, foraging, migration, mixed flocking and nest parasitism). We also welcome papers with a strong conservation focus, for example new insights into the conservation status of threatened species, the illegal bird trade, habitat restoration and management, extinctions and habitat fragmentation effects. Comprehensive avifaunal inventories of particular regions or islands are welcome contributions. On the other hand, single species records new to a country or region are considered only in exceptional circumstances. The Journal of Asian Ornithology places emphasis on (1) the novelty of research results and (2) region-wide significance. Contributions in which the novelty of results is not immediately clear, or in which authors have not established how their results further our insights into a topic in comparison with previous results, are not usually considered for review. Equally, novel ornithological results that are only locally or nationally, but not regionally, significant, are not generally considered for review. We encourage authors to familiarise themselves with the scope of our sister journal BirdingASIA, which will under some circumstances be a more appropriate choice for interesting and appealing studies that are locally or nationally significant. The editorial boards of the Journal of Asian Ornithology and BirdingASIA may discuss the suitability of some manuscript submissions, which may result in an editorial recommendation for manuscript transfers.

Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. Results Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category ‘other poultry’. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. Conclusions Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.",https://link.springer.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-020-4918-y,link.springer.com,marianne,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.54310423251018,['peafowl'],777

Nevertheless, understanding the biogeographical histories of these groups (e.g. Accipitriformes, Passeriformes) is important when studying the evolution of variation in life history and behavioural traits. Therefore, we would like to find answers to questions such as which biogeographic changes affected the radiation of birds? When did the most influential climatic events affect the diversification of birds? What behavioural adaptations occurred in response to those large-scale changes? The major orogenetic events in Asia and South America formed specific corridors that enabled the radiation of birds. The climatic changes and habitat differentiation they caused during the Oligocene–Miocene era made the divergence of birds possible through their adaptation to newly available niches.

(Asteraceae) shows early connections of two disjunct biodiversity hotspots","The Andes is recognized as one of the most biodiverse places on Earth, promoting in its uplift process a series of recent rapid diversification events in different biotic groups like birds, mammals, insects and vascular plants. The uplift of the Andes during the Cenozoic acted as a barrier for many biotic groups, as a scenario for radiation processes due to occupancy of different niches and as a corridor for others. Connections between the Andes and the Atlantic Forest showed intermittent phases along the Cenozoic, affecting the distribution patterns and diversification of different biotic groups. Nowadays, the Andes and the Atlantic Forest are both considered globally relevant biodiversity hotspots. Floristic groups thriving in both hotspots are crucial for a better understanding of their biogeographic history, as well as for informing future conservation actions. Mutisia (Asteraceae), a genus comprising 63 perennial shrubs and vines endemic to South America, shows a marked West-East disjunction: Most species occupy almost the whole Andean chain from Colombia to Patagonia, while a second group encompasses four species distributed in eastern Brazil and the surrounding areas of Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina. We reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus to assess its possible biogeographic history. We analysed three DNA regions, i.e. the chloroplast trnL-trnF intergenic spacer and the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, ITS and ETS. Using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, gene trees were reconstructed, and a concatenated phylogenetic tree was inferred. Divergence times were estimated by means of BEAST, and the ancestral areas were inferred using BioGeoBEARS. An ancestral reconstruction of morphological traits was also performed, as well as maps representing current richness hotspots within the genus. Phylogenetic analyses strongly support the monophyly of Mutisia, with two well-supported main clades: clade A, with presence of Atlantic-central-northern Andes species, and clade B, with central/southern Andes species. Dating analyses suggest that a main clade separation occurred at the early Miocene, followed by the separation of the Atlantic clade A2 by the late Miocene, and more recent radiations occurred in the central, northern and southern Andes during the Pliocene. Results are in tune with other angiosperm taxa that also underwent rapid radiations, possibly related to environmental and pollinator changes. The biogeographic history of Mutisia is related to morphological adaptations, history and geographic factors acting since the Miocene along the Andes and adjacent areas.

Avian blood THg concentrations (n = 31, from eight species in five foraging guilds) ranged widely from 0.2 to 32 ng g−1 (median of 4.3 ng g−1). Within this population, THg was significantly greater at a low-elevation site near a wetland compared to an upland montane site, even when the comparison was limited to a single species. Overall, however, THg concentrations were approximately an order of magnitude lower than comparable populations in the continental U.S. In surface soil and sediment, potential rates of demethylation were 3 to 9-fold greater than those for Hg(II)-methylation (based on six radiotracer amendment incubations), but rates of change of ambient MeHg pools showed a slight net positive Hg(II)-methylation. Thus, the resolution of the paradox is that MeHg degradation approximately keeps pace with MeHg production in this landscape. Further, any net production of MeHg is subject to frequent flushing by high rainfall on chronically wet soils. The interplay of these microbial processes and hydrology appears to shield the local food web from adverse effects of high atmospheric mercury loading. This scenario may play out in other humid tropical ecosystems as well, but it is difficult to evaluate because coordinated studies of Hg deposition, methylation, and trophic uptake have not been conducted at other tropical sites.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10646-019-02108-z.pdf,link.springer.com,bananaquit,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.55365193138749,,910

We evaluate several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in a butterfly family, the&nbsp;Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generate a time-calibrated phylogeny containing 2,866 nymphalid species (~45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the latitudinal diversity gradient among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. The Neotropical diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and biotic interchanges with other regions are rare. Southeast Asia is also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, is the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, combined with tropical niche conservatism, played a major role in generating the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of nymphalid&nbsp;butterflies. A phylogeny of Nymphalidae butterflies unveils the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient.

A sudden extinction caused by an asteroid is the most accepted hypothesis but it is debated whether dinosaurs were in decline or not before the impact. We analyse the speciation-extinction dynamics for six key dinosaur families, and find a decline across dinosaurs, where diversification shifted to a declining-diversity pattern ~76 Ma. We investigate the influence of ecological and physical factors, and find that the decline of dinosaurs was likely driven by global climate cooling and herbivorous diversity drop. The latter is likely due to hadrosaurs outcompeting other herbivores. We also estimate that extinction risk is related to species age during the decline, suggesting a lack of evolutionary novelty or adaptation to changing environments. These results support an environmentally driven decline of non-avian dinosaurs well before the asteroid impact. Dinosaurs are thought to have been driven extinct by an asteroid impact 66 million years ago. Here, Condamine et al. show that six major dinosaur families were already in decline in the preceding 10 million years, possibly due to global cooling and competition among herbivores.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23754-0.pdf,nature.com,fanti,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.58045086144225,,295

Nevertheless, shrikes hesitate to attack the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), which specializes in plundering passerine nests. Our previous studies have suggested that this behaviour may be the result of an alternative defence strategy, relying on nest crypsis. To test this hypothesis, at the shrike nests, we presented a magpie dummy associated with playbacks drawing the predators’ attention to the presence of the nest. We predicted that the presentation of a magpie dummy associated with shrike alarm calls moves the parents to action, causing them to chase the magpie away from the nest. We showed that the presence of a magpie dummy associated with shrike alarm calls elicits a significantly more active response in shrike parents compared to a magpie dummy associated with neutral song. Parents actively moved around the dummy and produced alarm calls; nevertheless, most of the tested pairs hesitated to attack the dummy. We may conclude that the low nest defence activity of shrike parents towards magpie dummy was partly the result of an alternative strategy, which may be cancelled out by alerting the predator to the location of the nest; nevertheless, shrikes seem to be afraid of the magpie and hesitate to attack it physically.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-021-01552-x.pdf,link.springer.com,shrike-jay,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.59466833200924,"['pica pica', 'lanius collurio', 'magpie', 'eurasian magpie']",239

Abstract
The peach root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne floridensis, is an emerging species and may become a threat to peach growers if contamination and spread are not avoided. The influence of temperature and two plants – tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and French marigold (Tagete patula) – on the vertical migration of second-stage juveniles (J2) of M. floridensis was studied using 14-cm long segmented soil columns. Plants were transplanted into cups attached to the top of each column. Nylon meshes were placed between cups and columns to prevent downward root growth. About 1,000 freshly hatched J2 were injected into the base of the columns and then the columns were transferred to growth chambers at 20 and 26°C under a completely randomized block design with four replicates. The number of J2 in each ring of the columns as well as inside tomato or marigold roots was recorded at 3, 6, 9, and 12 days after injection (DAI). Nematode data were subjected to a repeated measures MANOVA. The presence of plants did not improve J2 migration as compared to control. M. floridensis migration was best at 20°C at first, with J2 migrating more than 13 cm as soon as 3 DAI, while it took 9 DAI for J2",https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.21307/jofnem-2021-074,sciendo.com,graminicola,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-8.637424651668514,['knot'],252

We investigated the repeatability of five frequently used linear measurements of avian traits: wing length, tarsus length, bill length, bill depth and bill width and the validity of proxies for three traits: bill surface area, structural body size and tarsus size, using species from the infra-order Meliphagides (honeyeaters, fairy wrens and their allies). Repeatability varied between traits and across species for a given trait: traits larger than 13 mm showed high repeatability compared with smaller traits. By incorporating microCT technology, we showed that the formula for the surface area of a cone, a widely used proxy of bill surface area, accurately describes bill surface area within species. Surface measurement of tarsus and wing lengths were valid proxies for underlying osteology.

Recent studies focused on gut bacterial diversity in birds and poultry, with little information about the ecological functions of their gut fungal community. The high-throughput sequencing was applied to compare intestinal fungal community structure between Hooded Crane (Grus monacha) and Domestic Goose (Anser anser domesticus), and infer the potential pathogens of each species at Shengjin Lake of China. Intestinal fungal alpha diversity was higher in Hooded Crane than Greylag Goose (Anser anser). Gut fungal community composition showed dramatic shifts between the two species. Hooded Cranes mainly eat Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton malaianus, while artificial hurl food (i.e., paddy) was the main food resource for Domestic Geese, suggesting that the variations in fungal community might be induced by different diets between the two hosts. Two enriched genera (i.e., Acremonium and Rhodotorula) which could increase host’s digestion were detected in guts of Hooded Cranes. In addition, there were 42 pathogenic amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), 17% of which shared in Hooded Crane and Greylag Goose. The Hooded Crane had higher gut fungal pathogenic diversity and abundance relative to Greylag Goose. The study demonstrated that divergence in intestinal fungal community structure might be induced by different diets between wintering Hooded Crane and Domestic Goose. Hooded Crane might rely more on their gut fungal taxa to acquire nutrients from indigestible food resources.

There are two broad reasons for this: the first problem with the invasive species narrative is that this demonisation of ‘invasives’ is morally wrong, particularly because it usually results in the unjust killing of the animals in question. Following on from this, the second problem is that the narrative is also incoherent, both from scientific and philosophical perspectives. At the heart of both of these issues is the problem that the invasive species narrative oversimplifies what are in fact very complex biological processes. As a result, the policies carried out with the stated aim of ‘controlling’ these animals are often unethical. In light of the current global species decline, this article asserts that the way we think and talk about these animals should be changed and the term ‘invasive species’ should be discontinued, in the hope that this leads to changes in practice.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10806-020-09825-0.pdf,link.springer.com,native-hen,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.64556062053973,,774

However, many mammals that prey on birds have dichromatic visual systems with only two types of color-sensitive visual receptors, rather than the three and four photoreceptors characteristic of humans and most birds, respectively. Here, we use a combination of multispectral imaging, reflectance spectroscopy, color vision modelling and visual texture analysis to compare the visual signals available to conspecifics and to mammalian predators from multicolored feathers from the Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus), as well as red and yellow parrot feathers. We also model the effects of distance-dependent blurring due to visual acuity. When viewed by birds against green vegetation, most of the feathers studied are estimated to have color and brightness contrasts similar to values previously found for ripe fruit. On the other hand, for dichromat mammalian predators, visual contrasts for these feathers were only weakly detectable and often below detection thresholds for typical viewing distances. We also show that for dichromat mammal vision models, the peacock’s train has below-detection threshold color and brightness contrasts and visual textures that match various foliage backgrounds. These findings are consistent with many feathers of similar hue to those studied here being inconspicuous, and in some cases potentially cryptic, in the eyes of common mammalian predators of adult birds. Given that birds perform many conspicuous motions and behaviors, this study suggests that mammalian predators are more likely to use other sensory modalities (e.g., motion detection, hearing, and olfaction), rather than color vision, to detect avian prey. This suggests new directions for future behavioral studies and emphasizes the importance of understanding the influence of the sensory ecology of predators in the evolution of animal coloration.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210924&type=printable,journals.plos.org,peacock,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.64583656218487,['pavo cristatus'],1092

All of these ‘rias’ drain catchments with Devonian and Carboniferous rocks that were intruded by granite during the Variscan Orogeny and which were mineralized at that time. The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Heritage UNESCO World Heritage Site records the exploitation of these minerals since Roman times, though mining ceased in the twentieth century. All these mineralized rocks, mining waste and the occasional ‘flood’ of old mine workings have contaminated the estuaries with Cu, Zn, Sn, As, Cr, Hg, Ag, etc., which, in many places, may have left a record of foraminifera with test abnormalities. Since 1973, in a series of student-led projects, the estuaries of the region have been studied for their foraminiferal assemblages, sometimes including sampling strategies that meant monthly, or 3-monthly, suites of samples being collected. The Fal Estuary is one of the largest and most complex of the ‘rias’ and, while draining mineralized areas, also suffered a major release of acidic mine waste during a flood in January 1992. Recovery from that ‘event’ showed that the total absence of foraminifera began to recover within 2 years and assemblages have now returned to pre-incident levels, though still recording malformed individuals.

The endocast of the Night Parrot revealed relatively small optic lobes and optic foramina, especially compared with closely related grass parakeets, but no apparent differences in orbit dimensions. Our data suggests that the Night Parrot likely has lower visual acuity than most other parrots, including its congener, the Eastern Ground Parrot (P. wallicus).

Comparing Knepp Estate rewilding project with ‘traditional’ nature conservation,"‘Rewilding’ is an increasingly prominent concept in conservation, but one that has attracted controversy. Debate frequently focuses on human ‘control’ over nature. ‘Traditional’ conservation has been presented as involving ‘high control,’ and rewilding as ‘low control.’ Opposition to rewilding often stems from a perceived lack of control and associated perception of increased risk and uncertainty. This paper explores the concept of control in conservation. I identify multiple dimensions of control (‘stabilisation’, ‘location’, ‘prediction’ and ‘outputs’), illustrating that control is not a simple, linear concept. I compare two ethnographic case studies: the Sussex Wildlife Trust’s Old Lodge nature reserve; and Knepp Estate, one of the most influential rewilding projects in the UK. I use them to test assertions made about control in ‘traditional’ conservation and ‘rewilding’. I outline how Old Lodge does not exert precise control in all respects, but involves elements of uncertainty and negotiation. I describe how Knepp’s model of rewilding reduces control in some dimensions but potentially increases it in others. I conclude that, while Knepp’s rewilding does represent a significant conceptual departure from ‘traditional’ conservation, it should not be characterised as an approach that reduces control in a simplistic way. Based on this analysis, I argue that reduction of control does not necessarily underpin the concept of rewilding. Rather, there is interplay between different control dimensions that combine to form multiple ‘configurations of control.’ Using a framework of ‘configurations of control’, debate about the place of rewilding in conservation can become less polarised, and instead involve an active discussion of what configuration of control is desired. This analysis has the potential to increase understanding of rewilding projects as part of plural conservation strategies, in the UK and globally.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241160&type=printable,journals.plos.org,bracken-warbler,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.66515299462273,,323

Cable deployments in coastal waters are increasing worldwide, in capacity and number, owing to growing demands for electrical power and telecommunications. Increasingly, the local electromagnetic environment used by electro- and magneto-sensitive species will be altered. We quantified biologically relevant behavioural responses of the presumed, magneto-receptive American lobster and the electro-sensitive Little skate to electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions of a subsea high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission cable for domestic electricity supply. We demonstrate a striking increase in exploratory/foraging behaviour in skates in response to EMF and a more subtle exploratory response in lobsters. In addition, by directly measuring both the magnetic and electric field components of the EMF emitted by HVDC cables we found that there were DC and unexpectedly AC components. Modelling, restricted to the DC component, showed good agreement with measured results. Our cross-disciplinary study highlights the need to integrate an understanding of the natural and anthropogenic EMF environment together with the responses of sensitive animals when planning future cable deployments and predicting their environmental effects.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60793-x.pdf,nature.com,paille,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.67604485965376,,775

In the current study, we re-evaluated the taxonomy of the C. sibiricus complex using molecular, acoustic and morphological data.

Background: In this paper, we present evidence that biologging is strongly correlated with eye irritation, with 
sometimes severely impairing effects. A migratory population of the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita, NBI) is 
reintroduced in Europe, in course of a LIFE + project. Since 2014, all individuals have been equipped with GPS-devices. 
Remote monitoring allows the implementation of focussed measures against major mortality causes.
Methods: Initially all birds carried battery-powered devices, fixed on the lower back of the birds. Since 2016 an 
increasing amount of birds has been equipped with solar-powered devices, fixed on the upper back, the more sun-
exposed position. In 2016, we observed opacity in the cornea of one eye (unilateral corneal opacity; UCO) during a 
regular health monitoring for the first time.
Results: By 2018, a total of 25 birds were affected by UCO, with varying intensity up to blindness. Clinical examina-
tion of the birds revealed no clear cause for the symptoms. However, only birds carrying a device on the upper back 
were affected (2017 up to 70% of this group). In contrast, none of the birds carrying devices on the lower back ever 
showed UCO symptoms. This unexpected relationship between tagging and UCO was discovered in 2017. After we 
took countermeasures by removing the device or repositioning it on the lower back, we observed an immediate 
reduction of the incidence rate without any new cases reported since January 2019. NBI roost with their head on the 
back, one eye closely placed to the device if it was positioned on the upper back. Thus, we conclude that the most 
parsimonious explanation for the symptomatology is either a repetitive slight temperature rise in the corneal tissue 
due to electromagnetic radiation by the GSM module of the device or a repetitive slight mechanical irritation of the 
corneal surface. Concrete evidence is missing so far. Meanwhile, cases of UCO were found in another NBI population.
Conclusion: Our observations indicate that further research in the fast-growing field of biologging is urgently 
needed. The findings question the positioning of devices on the upper back in birds roosting with the head on the 
back.

Leach’s Storm-Petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous) are burrow-nesting seabirds that breed on coastal islands throughout much of the North Atlantic, with most of the world’s population breeding in Atlantic Canada. Population declines in the past 20–30 years have resulted in the species being uplisted to “Vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. One of the species’ most well-studied colonies is on Kent Island, New Brunswick in the Bay of Fundy. To determine if this colony has faced declines over a similar timescale, census work was conducted in June and July of 2000/2001 and 2018. Forty-one east-west transects in 2000/2001 (516 plots) and 56 east to west transects in 2018 (678 plots) were established every 50 m along the length of the island, which were censused with 10 m² plots. Population estimates were calculated by extrapolating mean occupied burrow density over the area of suitable nesting habitat on the island. Additionally, habitat characteristics and predator presence were recorded within each plot, and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to determine which environmental factors affected burrow densities and occupancy rate. The estimated number of breeding pairs for the entire island in 2018 was 21,643 (CI 16,942–26,343) and has declined at an annual rate of -1.79% (CI -3.28% to -0.25%) since 2000/2001 (29,416 CI 23,015–35,817 pairs), though population trends varied across the island with forested habitat experiencing a large decline and the open habitat experiencing a marginal increase. CART models revealed that occupied burrow densities were highest in areas dominated by ferns or shrub/bramble that had no signs of forest regrowth, and had low gull nesting densities. Our results suggest that Leach’s Storm-Petrels are declining at the southern extent of their range at similar rates exhibited at northern colonies, especially in forested habitat where habitat change may be influencing nest-site use.
RÉSUMÉ
Les pétrels cul-blanc (Hydrobates leucorhous) sont des oiseaux marins nichant dans des terriers, qui se reproduisent sur les îles côtières le long d'une grande partie de la côte nord-Atlantique, principalement le long de la côte Atlantique du Canada. Leur population a décliné au cours de 20 à 30 dernières années, de sorte que cette espèce est désormais classée comme « vulnérable » sur la Liste rouge des espèces menacées de Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature.

Leach’s Storm-Petrels (Hydrobates leucorhous) are burrow-nesting seabirds that breed on coastal islands throughout much of the North Atlantic, with most of the world’s population breeding in Atlantic Canada. Population declines in the past 20–30 years have resulted in the species being uplisted to “Vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. One of the species’ most well-studied colonies is on Kent Island, New Brunswick in the Bay of Fundy. To determine if this colony has faced declines over a similar timescale, census work was conducted in June and July of 2000/2001 and 2018. Forty-one east-west transects in 2000/2001 (516 plots) and 56 east to west transects in 2018 (678 plots) were established every 50 m along the length of the island, which were censused with 10 m² plots. Population estimates were calculated by extrapolating mean occupied burrow density over the area of suitable nesting habitat on the island. Additionally, habitat characteristics and predator presence were recorded within each plot, and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to determine which environmental factors affected burrow densities and occupancy rate. The estimated number of breeding pairs for the entire island in 2018 was 21,643 (CI 16,942–26,343) and has declined at an annual rate of -1.79% (CI -3.28% to -0.25%) since 2000/2001 (29,416 CI 23,015–35,817 pairs), though population trends varied across the island with forested habitat experiencing a large decline and the open habitat experiencing a marginal increase. CART models revealed that occupied burrow densities were highest in areas dominated by ferns or shrub/bramble that had no signs of forest regrowth, and had low gull nesting densities. Our results suggest that Leach’s Storm-Petrels are declining at the southern extent of their range at similar rates exhibited at northern colonies, especially in forested habitat where habitat change may be influencing nest-site use.
RÉSUMÉ
Les pétrels cul-blanc (Hydrobates leucorhous) sont des oiseaux marins nichant dans des terriers, qui se reproduisent sur les îles côtières le long d'une grande partie de la côte nord-Atlantique, principalement le long de la côte Atlantique du Canada.

How animals’ appearances prevent detection or recognition is well studied, but the role of prey behavior has received much less attention. Here we report a series of experiments with twig-mimicking larvae of the American peppered moth Biston betularia that test the long-held view that prey have evolved postures that enhance their camouflage, and establish how food availability and ambient temperature affect these postures. We found that predators took longer to attack larvae that were resting in a twig-like posture than larvae resting flat against a branch. Larvae that were chilled or food restricted (manipulations intended to energetically stress larvae) adopted a less twig-like posture than larvae that were fed ad libitum. Our findings provide clear evidence that animals gain antipredator benefits from postural camouflage, and suggest that benefits may come at an energetic cost that animals are unwilling or unable to pay under some conditions.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78686-4.pdf,nature.com,potoo,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-8.69693669592735,,496

In the study reported here we evaluated the taxonomic status of these taxa and discussed key features involved in speciation. All three taxa exhibited multiple differences in plumage, morphology, and vocalizations, supporting the recognition of three species in Rhynchospiza. The very large-billed R. stolzmanni has a song composed of a succession of faster complex trilled phrases, shows a small black loral line and dark-chestnut head stripes with large dark central-stripe to individual feathers, and is resident in the Tumbes region. The large and heavy dabbenei has a song consisting of a series of simple chirping notes, shows a large black loral crescent and chestnut head stripes with a reduced to absent dark center to feathers, and inhabits the Austral Yungas as a year-round resident. The small and pale strigiceps has a song consisting of a succession of complex trilled phrases, shows a small black loral line and rufous-brown head stripes with large dark central-stripe to feathers, and inhabits Dry and Sierran Chaco where it is a partial migrant. Locality data and ecological niche modeling show that dabbenei and strigiceps are allo-parapatric and use different altitudinally segregated habitats at their zone of parapatry. Molecular phylogenetic analyses (NADH dehydrogenase 2 [ND2] gene) revealed R. stolzmanni to be sister (11.5% divergent) to a recently diverged dabbenei and strigiceps clade (1.6% divergent). We conclude that the genus Rhynchospiza comprises three species-level entities, each restricted to a major biogeographic region, and that vocalizations and facial patterns provide key evidence on species limits in these otherwise similarly plumaged taxa. The evolutionary–cultural differences in songs, with complex phrases in those of R. strigiceps and R. stolzmanni, and single notes in the songs of R. dabbenei, suggest changes in the innate vocal learning template during speciation in the latter.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01695-2.pdf,link.springer.com,chaco-finch,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.69906196159214,['tumbes sparrow'],988

It is expected that social species will possess a functionally and structurally complex vocal repertoire. While several studies on mammalian systems exist supporting this, evidence from avian systems is comparatively limited. Towards this, we present evidence for complex acoustic communication in a cooperatively breeding passerine, Jungle Babbler. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 call types produced in either affiliative or agonistic context. These calls mediated the coordination of various social behaviours including group movement, foraging, brood care, aggression and vigilance. Yet, 8 out of 15 vocalizations were produced in the context of vigilance. This disproportionate investment of vocalizations towards coordinated acoustic vigilance is characteristic of many cooperatively breeding birds. Discriminant function analysis based on acoustic features verifies the classification of calls based on behavioural contexts. We also find evidence for the prediction that functionally similar calls are likely to be structurally similar as well. Multisyllabic calls were found to be composed of acoustically distinct notes that occur in a defined order in most cases. This implies that there may be underlying rules that determine call composition to give rise to functional calls to which receivers respond. Our study demonstrates that Jungle Babblers possess a structurally and functionally complex vocal repertoire. It also lays the foundation for future investigations on combinatorial and syntactical rules underlying call function and structure in bird vocalizations. Significance statement Studies on vocal complexity in birds have focussed mainly on repertoire size, structure and function. However, acoustic features of elements that constitute a call/song are rarely examined to evaluate vocal complexity. We examined complex communication in a cooperatively breeding social passerine, Jungle Babbler, for which we assessed repertoire size, function, acoustic features of calls and their constituent elements. Jungle Babblers were found to possess a functionally diverse vocal repertoire comprising 15 call types, 53% of which were in the context of vigilance. Discriminant function analysis based on acoustic features upheld the context-based call classification, implying that the calls were both functionally and structurally distinct. We also found that several calls were composed of multiple, acoustically distinct notes. These findings will be foundational in understanding the interrelations between sociality and communicative complexity and underlying combinatorial rules that determine call structure and function.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03018-z.pdf,link.springer.com,monias,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.70573489415727,['jungle babbler'],254

Cholera causes epidemics and pandemics, but the ways this disease spreads worldwide is still unclear. This review highlights a relatively new hypothesis regarding the way V. cholerae can be globally dispersed. Copepods and chironomids are natural reservoirs of V. cholerae and are part of different fish species’ diet. Furthermore, V. cholerae inhabits marine and freshwater fish species. Waterbird species feed on fish or on small invertebrates such as copepods and chironomids. Waterbirds have also been found to carry living copepods and/or chironomids internally or externally from one waterbody to another. All of the above points to the fact that some waterbird species might be vectors of V. cholerae. Indeed, we and others have found evidence for the presence of V. cholerae non-O1 as well as O1 in waterbird cloacal swabs, feces, and intestine samples. Moreover, hand-reared cormorants that were fed on tilapia, a fish that naturally carries V. cholerae, became infected with this bacterial species, demonstrating that V. cholerae can be transferred to cormorants from their fish prey. Great cormorants as well as other waterbird species can cover distances of up to 1,000 km/day and thus may potentially transfer V. cholerae in a short time across and between continents. We hope this review will inspire further studies regarding the understanding of the waterbirds' role in the global dissemination of V. cholerae.",https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007814&type=printable,journals.plos.org,crab-plover,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.71163968693119,,972

In the present study, 30 pig carcasses were stored in three different types of containers (suitcases, trashcans and drums) with different levels of access for necrophagous insects at two different geographic locations for 100 days. The decomposition proceeded in a similar way in both geographic locations in all three types of container. Both in trashcans and suitcases, the decomposition process was characterised by bones and greasy, brown decomposition fluids left in the containers and an overall moist decomposition. In contrast, decomposition in the drums was characterised by a long bloating phase followed by a slow transition from bloated to deflation. Tissue and the carcasses as a whole were still present till the end of the experiment. Insect occurrence patterns and species composition on suitcases and trashcans were similar for both countries. Mainly flies and some beetles were present in suitcases and trashcans until day 45, with blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) dominating the fauna. There was no insect colonisation in the drums.

The collars provided data spanning 317 ± 61 days (N = 14 deployments). The data allowed us to document spatial use during the end of the breeding season, the whole non-breeding season, and into the subsequent breeding season. About 30% of individuals in the study, all marked in 2009, did not show large seasonal changes in spatial use. However, the remaining birds moved up to 150 km from their nesting areas and averaged a 24-fold increase in range size during the non-breeding season. During the non-breeding season most members of both species engaged in exploratory flights of about 20 km perhaps to gather information on food availability at the landscape level. Surprisingly, range sizes, range shift timing, and most other movement parameters did not differ between the two macaw species studied. In addition, most individuals of both species moved outside the 1.36 million hectare protected area complex during the non-breeding season, highlighting the need for large protected areas to conserve these macaws in the forests of the western Amazon basin.

Whether these birds were industrially raised or massively hunted is a matter of heavy debate as it would have a significant impact on the economy related to their supply and cult, and if hunted it would have represented an ecological burden on the birds populations. Here we have measured and analysed the stable oxygen, carbon and radiogenic strontium isotope compositions as well as calcium and barium content of bones along with the stable carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotope composition of feathers from 20 mummified ibises and birds of prey recovered from various archeological sites of Ancient Egypt. If these migratory birds were locally bred, their stable oxygen, radiogenic strontium and stable sulfur isotopic compositions would be similar to that of coexisting Egyptians, and their stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope variance would be close, or lower than that of Egyptians. On one hand, isotopic values show that ibises ingested food from the Nile valley but with a higher isotopic scattering than observed for the diet of ancient Egyptians. On the other hand, birds of prey have exotic isotopic values compatible with their migratory behaviour. We therefore propose that most mummified ibises and all the birds of prey analysed here were wild animals hunted for religious practice.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72326-7.pdf,nature.com,soufré,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.75600360726483,,575

To date, the observation of animal behavior in the presence of visual illusions has been largely confined to mammal and bird studies. Recently, there has been increasing interest in investigating fish, too. The attention has been particularly focused on guppies, redtail splitfin and bamboo sharks. Overall, the tested species were shown to experience a human-like perception of different illusory phenomena involving size, number, motion, brightness estimation and illusory contours. However, in some cases, no illusory effects, or evidence for a reverse illusion, were also reported. Here, we review the current state of the art in this field. We conclude that a wider investigation of visual illusions in fish is fundamental to form a broader comprehension of perceptual systems of vertebrates. Furthermore, we believe that this type of investigation could help us to address general important issues in perceptual studies, such as the role of ecology in shaping perceptual systems, the existence of interindividual variability in the visual perception of nonhuman species and the role of cortical activity in the emergence of visual illusions.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-019-01341-7.pdf,link.springer.com,solitaire,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-8.7610135369246,,839

Osteometrics is a tool for understanding skeletal variation in animal populations that has been shown to be useful in distinguishing between closely related genera in galliform post-cranial elements. In this paper, we test whether metrics are also effective in identifying galliform skulls (crania and mandibles) to the genus level. Using osteometric data collected from nine North American gallinaceous genera, we found that size was the greatest source of variation within the order. Several dimensions (greatest height, smallest breadth between orbits and length of incisivum) on the cranium were successful in distinguishing Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) from Ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), while measurements on the mandible were not very effective in separating closely related taxa. The application of osteometrics to fragmentary bird skulls from an historic era site assemblage in New York was not effective in identifying birds beyond general size-classes even with the aid of morphology and comparative collections.

A brush-like arrangement of flowers has evolved in multiple plant families. The accessible rewards in these “brush flowers” are often utilized by both birds and insects, making it challenging to assess which are the main contributors to pollination. We investigated two such species, Scadoxus puniceus and S. membranaceus, by means of camera trapping, direct observations, and selective exclusion and controlled pollination experiments in order to determine the extent to which sunbirds contribute to their pollination. We found that flowers of S. puniceus are frequently visited by sunbirds, butterflies and honeybees, whereas those of S. membranaceus are rarely visited. Birds typically perch directly on the densely packed flowers of S. puniceus and pick up large, visible pollen loads on their beaks, heads and feet as they feed on nectar. The flowers of this species match the bills of the sunbirds in length, and the floral nectar properties are also consistent with specialisation for pollination by sunbirds. Butterflies feed on the nectar of S. puniceus, but seldom contact the reproductive structures, likely limiting their effectiveness for pollen transfer. Selective exclusion of larger visitors, including birds and butterflies, negatively affected fruit and seed set for both species. Controlled pollination experiments revealed that S. puniceus is self-incompatible, whereas S. membranaceus is self-compatible and can set fruit autonomously.

Despite the increasingly recognised role of bare and highly vascularised body parts in heat exchange, the ecological and evolutionary determinants of urohidrosis have been largely ignored. We combine urohidrosis data from a scientifically curated media repository with microclimate and ecological data to investigate the determinants of urohidrosis in all extant stork species. Our phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models show that high temperature, humidity and solar radiation, and low wind speed, promote the use of urohidrosis across species. Moreover, species that typically forage in open landscapes exhibit a more pronounced use of urohidrosis than those mainly foraging in waterbodies. Substantial interspecific variation in temperature thresholds for urohidrosis prevalence points to different species vulnerabilities to high temperatures.

Vultures escaped sooner in response to the fixed-wing; however, fewer remained after multirotor treatments. Targeted approaches were perceived as riskier than overhead. Vulture perceived risk was enhanced by flying the multirotor in a targeted approach. We found no effect of our treatments on FID or latency to return. Latency was negatively correlated with UAS speed, perhaps because slower UAS spent more time over the area. Greatest visual saliency followed as: ornithopter, fixed-wing, and multirotor. Despite its appearance, the ornithopter was not effective at dispersing vultures.

High prevalence of spill-over infection in equines was associated with reproductive losses. Newer avian chlamydial species are being reported in the recent years. It is a potential biological warfare agent and the disease is an occupational hazard mainly to custom officers handling exotic birds. Prevalence of the disease in wild birds, pet birds, and poultry causes economic losses to the poultry industry and the pet bird trade. Interestingly, there are speculations on the ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ bird trade that may be the global source of some of the most virulent strains of this pathogen. The mortality rate generally ranges from 5 to 40% in untreated cases, but it can sometimes be higher in co-infection. The intracellular lifestyle of this pathogen makes the diagnosis more complicated and there is also lack of accurate diagnostics. Resistance to antibiotics is reported only in some pathogens of the Chlamydiaceae family, but routine screening may assess the actual situation in all pathogens. Due to the diverse nature of the pathogen, the organism necessitates the One Health partnerships to have complete understanding. The present review focuses on the zoonotic aspects of avian chlamydiosis with its new insights into the pathogenesis, transmission, treatment, prevention, and control strategies. The review also briefs on the basic understandings and complex epidemiology of avian chlamydiosis, highlighting the need for research on emerging one health perspectives.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11250-021-02859-0.pdf,link.springer.com,seth-smith,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.84061185341521,,267

Tropical bird hosts shed new light on the adaptive significance of diurnal periodicity in parasite output,"Many parasites spend part of their life cycle as infectious forms released from an infected host in the external environment, where they may encounter and infect new hosts. The emergence of infectious life stages often occurs once a day to minimize mortality in adverse environments. In bird hosts, intestinal parasites such as coccidia are generally released with feces in the late afternoon. This dynamic is adaptive since it allows avoiding desiccation and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, thus reducing mortality of oocysts in the environment until transmission to the next host. If this circadian rhythm is the result of natural selection to increase oocyst survival, we may hypothesize that oocysts will appear in feces at different times depending on the environment where hosts live. Particularly, in an environment where UV radiation and desiccation are very low, we may expect oocyst circadian release to disappear since the main selective pressure would be relaxed. We sampled different species of birds in tropical and temperate forests in spring and investigated coccidian oocyst output. A strong circadian variation in the prevalence of hosts shedding coccidian oocyst was detected for species caught in the temperate forest with an increase in prevalence in the late afternoon, whereas prevalence of birds shedding oocysts was constant over the course of the day for most species sampled in the tropical rain forest. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that oocysts’ circadian output is maintained by natural selection to increase oocyst survival. We discuss the adaptive significance of diurnal periodicity in parasite output.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/366D9915DB0ED98E5FDCB21C8DD45F63/S003118202100202Xa.pdf/div-class-title-coccidial-oocyst-release-once-a-day-or-all-day-long-tropical-bird-hosts-shed-new-light-on-the-adaptive-significance-of-diurnal-periodicity-in-parasite-output-div.pdf,cambridge.org,euphonia,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.84805537378642,,170

It is, however, difficult to accurately measure how seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod affect physiological processes such as basal metabolic rate (BMR) and metabolic activity. To address this problem, we collected data in each month of the year on body mass (Mb) and BMR, and conducted a series of experiments to determine the effect of temperature and photoperiod on Mb, BMR and physiological markers of metabolic activity, in the Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus). In one experiment, we measured monthly change in Mb and BMR in a captive group of birds over a year. In another experiment, we examined the effects of acclimating birds to two different temperatures, 10 and 30 °C, and a long and a short photoperiod (16 h light:8 h dark and 8 h light:16 h dark, respectively) for 4 weeks. We found that these treatments induced sparrows to adjust their Mb and metabolic rate processes. Acclimation to 30 °C for 4 weeks significantly decreased sparrows’ Mb, BMR, and energy intake, including both gross energy intake and digestible energy intake, compared to birds acclimated to 10 °C. The dry mass of the liver, kidneys and digestive tract of birds acclimated to 30 °C also significantly decreased, although their heart and skeletal muscle mass did not change significantly relative to those acclimated to 10 °C. Birds acclimated to 30 °C also had lower mitochondrial state-4 respiration (S4R) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in their liver and skeletal muscle, compared to those acclimated to 10 °C. Birds acclimated to the long photoperiod also had lower mitochondrial S4R and COX activity in their liver, compared to those acclimated to the short photoperiod. These results illustrate the changes in morphology, physiology, and enzyme activity induced by seasonal change in temperature and photoperiod in a small temperate passerine. Both temperature and photoperiod probably have a strong effect on seasonal variation in metabolic heat production in small birds in temperate regions. The effect of temperature is, however, stronger than that of photoperiod.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00222-9,avianres.biomedcentral.com,hwamei,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-8.849454383019252,"['eurasian tree sparrow', 'passer montanus']",584

The mid-infrared emissivity showed no correlation with other investigated climatic factors. Phylogenetic independent contrasts analysis indicates the microstructures of butterfly wings may have evolved in part to regulate mid-infrared emissivity as an adaptation to climate, rather than as phylogenetic inertia.

The Rufous-sided Gerygone Gerygone dorsalis (Lapitis) is also very common and particularly confiding when foraging in grass or low shrubs.",en,Damar Island — Oriental Bird Club,"by Colin Trainor, OBC Bulletin 36, December 2002 Shaped like a dinosaurs head, with a steaming fumarole emitting discrete clouds of sulphur through a hypothetical nostril, the island of Damar has lain in wait for birders for over 100 years. That is, until recent work in August 2001 by BirdLife International to rediscover the Damar Flycatcher Ficedula henrici. Damar, like many islands in eastern Indonesia is remote more than 100 km to the nearest similarly sized islands of Romang and Babar. It is one of a string of volcanic islands starting with Java in the west and ending with the Banda Islands, south of Ambon. Damar is only about 198 km2, however it has a distinctive avifauna with its single endemic, the Damar Flycatcher Ficedula henrici and two endemic sub-species, Rufous-sided Gerygone Gerygone dorsalis kuehnii and Golden Whistler Pachycephala pectoralis dammeriana. Fifteen restricted-range species have also been recorded, including the near threatened Blue-streaked Lory Eos reticulata (perhaps introduced from the Tanimbar Islands), Green-cheeked Bronze Cuckoo Chrysococcyx rufomerus (a South-west island endemic), Orange-sided Thrush Zoothera peronii (a Timor-group endemic) and Cinnamon-collared Kingfisher Todiramphus australasia (widespread in the Lesser Sundas). Prior to their rediscovery in 2001, the Damar Flycatcher was first and last recorded in 1898 and the Green-cheeked Bronze Cuckoo (endemic to Damar, Romang, Kisar, Leti, Moa and Babar) in 1902. Damar is perhaps also the easiest place to see the other restricted-range species listed above. Combine this with extensive and scenic forest, coastal landscapes, and two spectacularly intact small islands to the south teeming with turtles, extensive fringing reef and Beach Thick-knees, Damar offers much for guests during a 7-10 day visit. Damar is, however, desperately undeveloped and has no electricity, no telephones, cars, motorbikes, hotels or losmen though hot running water is available from volcanic springs! Its isolation has maintained a particularly strong culture with tight social control managed by village heads. A total of 5000 people lives in seven villages, most of whom rely on the cash sale of coconuts and cloves together with subsistence crops (banana, cassava, chilli, tomato and papaya) and fishing for their livelihoods. Local transportation involves walking (23 h) or chartering motor boats (Johnsons) to other villages (30-90 min), which are all along the coast. Damar is best visited between July and October when the seas are calmer (especially September) and likelihood of rain lower. There are two separate local languages with the villages of Wulur through to Kumur having different local names for birds compared to the two westernmost villages of Batumerah and Kwai. Manu is the word for bird in the Wulur language. Access and accommodation Getting to Damar is difficult. Damar is accessible by public transport from Ambon and Saumlaki (Tanimbar Islands) and with greater difficulty from Kupang via Kisar Island (contact author for details). The most comfortable option would be to charter a yacht from Bali at about $US1500 per person/week. Access is perhaps easiest from Ambon, however this needs to be weighed against the ongoing civil unrest in this area (1998present). About every 20 days a kapal perintis ship, either the Iliana or Mentari 2 (but not both) departs Ambon on a route including Damar as the first port of call after about 26 h of travel (400 km). The ship is owned by PT Pelayanan Mentari Sejati Perkasa Ambon. Tickets cost only c. $US 2, however it is much more comfortable to arrange a cabin and bed ($US 10-15/night per bed). From Saumlaki, Tanimbar, the same ships are available at the other end of their route (ticket $US 34, bed as above), but travel to Damar takes 56 days via the islands of Babar, Sermata, Moa, Leti, Kisar, Wetar and Romang. Depending on your perspective, this is either wasted time or an opportunity to see some seabirds and get a look at some very remote and poorly known islands many without bird records for more than 100 years! From Kupang, West Timor, the ship Iramuar travels past the coast of Timor stopping a couple of times on Wetar, then on to Kisar (after c.48 h), where it will be necessary to disembark and wait for a boat continuing on to Damar. The Iramuar continues on to the Tanimbar Islands. Wulur area The village of Wulur is the largest on the island (c.1000 people) and all major ships stop in the Solat Bay between Wulur and Kehli making it the best base for birding on Damar. Stay with the kepala desa or village head Sigrandus Romode (until the year 2006) who can assist with arranging guides and other logistical aspects. Giving $US 23 per person/night for the accommodation and food will make any village stay more friendly and comfortable. Although there is much secondary forest and interesting mangroves and sago swamp at the mouth of the bay, it is best to head straight to the primary semi-evergreen forest about 2 km southwest of the village (a one hour walk) (ask to go to Yan Lutruwowans garden). This can be done as a day walk, or it is easy to arrange to camp in the garden, which is adjacent to primary forest.",,orientalbirdclub.org,honeyeater,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.86975530132733,"['zoothera peronii', 'gerygone dorsalis', 'damar flycatcher', 'pachycephala pectoralis', 'eos reticulata', 'chrysococcyx rufomerus', 'todiramphus australasia', 'golden whistler', 'ficedula henrici', 'streaked lory', 'cuckoo', 'collared kingfisher']",1000

However, studies using morphometric analysis and spectrophotometric techniques have revealed sexual size dimorphism and also sexual plumage color dimorphism among some species. The Monk Parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus), a native parrot of South America, is an interesting species for the study of plumage coloration and size since it is considered sexually monochromatic and monomorphic. Furthermore, recent studies show that the Monk Parakeet has extra-bond paternity behavior and even breeding trios, which suggests that sexual selection may play an important role in this species, and that it might have sexually dimorphic plumage (albeit imperceptible by humans) and be dimorphic in size. For the determination of plumage color we used spectrophotometry in the range of avian vision (300‒700 nm) and performed a morphological analysis. Our spectrophotometric results indicate that the Monk Parakeet shows subtle sexual plumage color dimorphism in three (crown, nape and wing) out of twelve body regions. Similarly, our morphometric analysis showed that there are subtle sex differences in body size (bill and weight). Although the Monk Parakeet shows extra-bond paternity and breeding trio behaviors which could increase sexual dimorphism, these behaviors occur among highly related individuals; perhaps the high rate of inbreeding is responsible for the attenuation of sexual plumage color dimorphism and sex differences in body size observed.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00204-x,avianres.biomedcentral.com,white-winged,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-8.87336985512123,"['myiopsitta monachus', 'monk parakeet']",685

Power outages associated with electrocutions are problematic for electric utilities focused on delivering reliable electric power. We used contextual data, photographs, line voltage, outage type and assessments of power line components to quantify outage-causing avian electrocutions throughout each of Iran’s 31 provinces. We evaluated records of 222 avian-caused outages involving 235 electrocuted birds in 2018. Of these, 14.5% involved species of conservation concern, and a few (at least eight) sparked fires when the plumage of electrocuted birds ignited and fell into dry vegetation. Most avian-caused outages (96%) involved distribution voltages, and 91% involved phase-to-ground contacts attributable to grounded concrete pylons with grounded steel crossarms. These are the most common type of power line structure in Iran. Insulators were involved in 37% of outage-causing avian electrocutions, fused cutouts 29%, transformers 33%, and midspan collisions 1%. Given the numbers of these components in the electrical system, fused cutouts and transformers were involved in more outage-causing avian electrocutions than expected due to chance. The average body size of electrocuted birds was largest for incidents involving suspension insulators, smaller for birds electrocuted on other insulators, and smallest for electrocutions on fused cutouts and transformers. Given that most avian electrocutions do not cause outages and given the similarity across electric systems in the region, our findings likely indicate a much larger avian electrocution concern throughout the middle east.

Various Mycoplasma (M.) spp. are causing severe respiratory signs in captive game bird species. Furthermore, M. gallisepticum is responsible for massive die-offs in consequence to severe conjunctivitis in house finches in the USA. Therefore, the prevalence of mycoplasmas in free-ranging pheasants was investigated and a potential impact on the population decline of pheasants discussed. Within this study, 150 free-ranging pheasants were sampled via tracheal swabs and tissue samples of the trachea and the periorbital skin, as the latter displayed inflammatory alterations in previous studies. In total, 177 samples were investigated for the presence of mycoplasmas using cultural and molecular biological methods. In 76 birds, necropsy was performed additionally.

Mycoplasma gallinaceum (n = 50), M. pullorum (n = 45), M. glycophilum (n = 43), M. iners (n = 11), and M. gallinarum (n = 5) were frequently isolated. In 45 cases (45.9%), multiple Mycoplasma spp. were isolated from one sample. All examined samples tested negative for M. gallisepticum. Of 51 skin samples investigated for mycoplasmas, 24 (47.1%) showed inflammatory skin alterations in histology, and 58.3% (14/24) of these samples tested positive for Mycoplasma spp. additionally.

Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes) abundance has declined by approximately 75% across North America since 1970. Despite this dramatic decline, Lesser Yellowlegs are infrequently studied on their breeding grounds and have rarely been studied in the boreal forest of Alaska where population size is uncertain. We used a spatially balanced sampling design and surveyed 400 by 400 m plots in 2016 and 2017 to (1) estimate abundance and habitat use of Lesser Yellowlegs breeding on military lands in interior Alaska, and (2) test hypotheses about which habitat covariates best explain variation in plot abundances and habitat use. We predicted that boreal forest habitats on military lands in central Alaska supported a large percent of breeding Lesser Yellowlegs and that plots containing water and situated closer to wetlands would have the highest abundances compared to other habitat variables tested. We also predicted that increased presence of lowland habitat and associated vegetation covariates (e.g., percent low scrub canopy) increased probability of habitat use. In 2017, Lesser Yellowlegs abundance at the study site was 12,478 individuals, and habitat use was negatively associated with increasing elevation and percent canopy cover on plot. We estimate that military lands in interior Alaska support 8% of all Lesser Yellowlegs breeding in Alaska. Therefore, studies identifying important Lesser Yellowlegs breeding habitat and addressing conservation priorities in the boreal forest should be continued.
RESUME_
La population de petits chevaliers (Tringa flavipes) a baissé d'environ 75 % en Amérique du Nord depuis 1970. Malgré ce déclin spectaculaire, les petits chevaliers sont rarement étudiés sur leurs territoires de reproduction et ont rarement fait l'objet d'études dans la forêt boréale d'Alaska, où l'importance de leur population est incertaine. Nous avons utilisé un modèle d'échantillonnage équilibré dans l'espace et observé des parcelles de 400 x 400 mètres en 2017 afin (1) d'estimer l'abondance et l'utilisation de l'habitat par les petits chevaliers qui se reproduisent sur les terrains militaires à l'intérieur de l'Alaska, et (2) de tester des hypothèses concernant les covariables de l'habitat qui expliquent le mieux les variations en termes d'abondance sur les parcelles et d'utilisation de l'habitat. Nous avions prédit que les habitats de la forêt boréale situés sur des terrains militaires du centre de l'Alaska accueillaient un fort pourcentage de petits chevaliers pendant la période de reproduction et que les parcelles contenant de l'eau et plus proches des terrains marécageux abritaient des populations plus nombreuses que les autres variables d'habitat étudiées. Nous pensions également que la présence accrue de covariables d'habitats de basse terre et de végétation associée (par ex. le pourcentage d'arbustes) augmentait la probabilité d'utilisation de l'habitat. En 2017, nous avions dénombré une population de 12 478 petits chevaliers sur le site de l'étude et l'utilisation de l'habitat était inférieurement proportionnelle à l'altitude croissante et au pourcentage de couverture de canopée sur les parcelles. Nous estimons que les terrains militaires de l'intérieur de l'Alaska abritent 8 % de l'ensemble de la population de petits chevaliers qui se reproduisent en Alaska. En conséquence, les études identifiant l'habitat de reproduction majeur des petits chevaliers et traitant des priorités de conservation dans la forêt boréale devraient être poursuivies.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art8/ACE-ECO-2021-2012.pdf,ace-eco.org,donaldson-smith,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-8.9371810783048,"['lesser yellowlegs', 'tringa flavipes']",50

Same/different abstract-concept learning experiments were conducted with two primate species and three avian species by
progressively increasing the size of the training stimulus set of distinctly different pictures from eight to 1,024 pictures. These
same/different learning experiments were trained with two pictures presented simultaneously. Transfer tests of same and different
learning employed interspersed trials of novel pictures to assess the level of correct performance on the very first time of subjects
had seen those pictures. All of the species eventually performed these tests with high accuracy, contradicting the long-accepted
notion that nonhuman animals are unable to learn the concept of same/different. Capuchin and rhesus monkeys learned the
concept more readily than did pigeons. Clark’s nutcrackers and black-billed magpies learned as readily as monkeys, and even
showed a slight advantage with the smallest training stimulus sets. Those tests of same/different learning were followed by delay
procedures, such that a delay was introduced after the subjects responded to the sample picture and before the test picture. In the
sequential same/different task, accuracy was shown to diminish when the stimulus on a previous trial matched the test picture
previously shown on a different trial. This effect is known as proactive interference. The pigeons’ proactive interference was
greater at 10-s delays than 1-s delays, revealing time-based interference. By contrast, time delays had little or no effect on rhesus
monkeys’ proactive interference, suggesting that rhesus monkeys have better explicit memory of where and when they saw the

Electrical transmission line development has been expanding globally by 5% per year, leading to increases in avian collisions with lines. Canadian estimates of transmission line collision mortalities range from 2.5 to 25.6 million birds per year, with the majority of mortalities attributed to collisions with overhead shield wires, and by susceptible birds that are young, large-bodied, with low maneuverability, or in open habitats. In this study, avian mortality was estimated for a ~4900 ha area in the mixed-grass prairie of southeastern Alberta following construction of two major transmission lines. We surveyed seven 500 m transects 7–10 times during both the breeding and migration seasons, where transects were categorized into road (n = 2), transmission line (n = 2), wetland (with transmission lines above; n = 1), or control (n = 2) areas. During the 2016 breeding season (5 May–24 June), we detected 23 mortalities under transmission lines, 7 mortalities beside roads, and no mortalities in controls. In the 2017 spring migration season (31 March–5 May), we detected 24 mortalities under transmission lines, 3 mortalities beside roads, and no mortalities in controls. Mortality rates were adjusted with biases estimated from detectability and scavenging trials. Scavenging rates were high (82% of carcasses were scavenged within 5 days) and detectability of deceased birds was positively related to body size. Overall, linear disturbances within the study area, including 37.7 km of highways and transmission lines, contributed to an estimated 75 deaths/km of linear disturbance during one migration and one breeding season (~50 deaths/km of transmission line and ~25 deaths/km of road; ~1904 bird mortalities total). These findings point to the need for mitigation to reduce bird mortality, thereby minimizing the long-term impact of linear disturbances, such as transmission lines and roads, on associated bird communities.
RÉSUMÉ
L'installation de lignes de transmission électrique s'est accrue de 5 % par an dans le monde, entraînant une augmentation des collisions d'oiseaux avec ces lignes. Les estimations canadiennes de la mortalité attribuable aux collisions avec les lignes de transmission se situent entre 2,5 et 25,6 millions d'oiseaux par an, la majorité des mortalités étant attribuées aux collisions avec les fils de blindage aériens et par des oiseaux sensibles, qui sont jeunes, de grande taille, peu manoeuvrables ou dans des habitats ouverts. Dans la présente étude, la mortalité d'oiseaux a été calculée pour une zone de ~4900 ha dans la prairie mixte du sud-est de l'Alberta suite à la construction de deux lignes de transmission majeures. Nous avons inventorié sept transects de 500 m de 7 à 10 fois pendant les saisons de nidification et de migration, les transects ayant été classés en zone de routes (n = 2), de lignes de transmission (n = 2), de milieux humides (avec des lignes de transmission au-dessus; n = 1) ou faisant office de témoin (n = 2). Au cours de la saison de nidification 2016 (5 mai-24 juin), nous avons détecté 23 mortalités sous des lignes de transmission, 7 mortalités à côté de routes et aucune mortalité dans les zones témoin. Au cours de la migration printanière 2017 (31 mars-5 mai), nous avons détecté 24 mortalités sous les lignes de transmission, 3 mortalités à côté de routes et aucune mortalité dans les zones témoin. Les taux de mortalité ont été ajustés au moyen de biais calculés à partir d'essais de détectabilité et de disparition des carcasses imputable aux charognards. Les taux de disparition étaient élevés (82 % des carcasses ont été éliminées dans les 5 jours) et la détectabilité des oiseaux morts était positivement liée à leur taille. Dans l'ensemble, les perturbations linéaires dans la zone d'étude, y compris 37,7 km d'autoroutes et de lignes de transmission, ont entraîné 75 mortalités/km de perturbation linéaire pendant une saison de migration et une saison de nidification (~50 mortalités/km de lignes de transmission et ~25 mortalités/km de routes; ~1904 mortalités d'oiseaux au total).

Various animal species worldwide use artificial environments for reproduction, a suitable alternative to dwindling native habitats. An artificial lake system established in the core zone of the Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, primarily intended for recreational purposes, assists wildlife to cope with water shortages and the extreme hot climate of the Arabian Desert. This area potentially opens up conflicts between recreational use and wildlife welfare. The Red-wattled Lapwing (Vanellus indicus aigneri) is a spreading Asian shorebird tightly linked to water resources and tolerant of human disturbance. We analyzed the habitat use and reproductive success of this species, following 361 nests and 373 chicks in 2018 and 2019 to reveal the breeding potential of the Reserve. The occurrence of lapwings dropped sharply at a distance of 500 m from the lakes, regardless of vegetation cover and desert type. In addition, nest site choice strongly reflected the proximity of water within the core lakes area. The Lapwings bred preferentially on islands built in the centers of the lakes, where they started breeding earlier in the season. They had a lower nest predation rate on islands than on the surrounding mainland, but the chicks grew slightly more slowly on islands, probably due to lower food availability. However, survival of island and mainland chicks was similar. We conclude that the shallow shores of lakes with islands make the area suitable for breeding of the Lapwing in the Arabian desert, despite extensive recreational use and constant human disturbance. This study shows an example of combining appropriate landscape design with benefits for humans and current support for wildlife conservation.
RÉSUMÉ
Différentes espèces animales à travers le monde se reproduisent dans des environnements artificiels, qui constituent une alternative adéquate à leurs habitats d'origine en déclin. Un réseau de lacs artificiels créé en plein coeur de la Réserve de conservation du désert d'Al Marmoom, à Dubai, aux Émirats Arabes Unis, principalement destiné à des activités de loisirs, aide la faune sauvage à gérer la sécheresse et les températures extrêmes qui règnent dans le désert d'Arabie. Cette zone pourrait éventuellement donner lieu à des conflits entre l'usage récréatif des terres et le bien-être de la faune. Le vanneau indien (Vanellus indicus aigneri) est un oiseau de rivage asiatique dont la population se propage et est étroitement liée aux ressources en eau et à sa tolérance des perturbations humaines. Nous avons analysé l'utilisation de l'habitat et le succès reproductif de cette espèce, en observant 361 nids et 373 oisillons en 2018 et 2019 afin de mettre en évidence le potentiel reproducteur de la réserve. La population de vanneaux déclinait considérablement à une distance de 500 m des lacs et ce, quels que soient la couverture végétale et le type de désert. En outre, le choix du site des nids reflétait fortement la proximité d'eau dans la zone centrale des lacs. Les vanneaux se reproduisaient de préférence sur des îles artificielles aménagées au centre des lacs, où leur saison de reproduction débutait plus tôt. Ils étaient confrontés à un taux de prédation des nids moindre sur les îles que sur les terres environnantes, mais les oisillons se développaient légèrement plus lentement sur les îles, probablement en raison d'une nourriture plus rare. Toutefois, la survie des oisillons sur les îles et sur le continent était similaire. Nous en concluons que les rives peu profondes des lacs abritant des îles favorisent la reproduction du vanneau dans le désert d'Arabie, en dépit d'une utilisation récréative intensive et de perturbations humaines constantes.

Results: Contrary to our own predictions, we find that dietary preferences for more- or less- mechanically resistant
foods have very little influence on beak and skull shape, and that diet predicts only 2.4% of the shape variation in
psittaciform beaks and skulls. Conversely, evolutionary allometry and integration together predict almost half the
observed shape variation, with phylogeny remaining an important factor in shape identity throughout our analyses,
particularly in separating cockatoos (Cacatuoidea) from the true parrots (Psittacoidea).
Conclusions: Our results are similar to recent findings about the evolutionary trajectories of skull and beak shape in
other avian families. We therefore propose that allometry and integration are important factors causing canalization
of the avian head, and while diet clearly has an influence on beak shape between families, this may not be as
important at driving evolvability within families as is commonly assumed.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12862-019-1432-1.pdf,link.springer.com,vulturine,2022-04-11,0,1,1,1,1,-9.01368428519638,,1072

Wild animals need to act at the right moment to catch prey or escape a predator. Land plants, although limited in their movement, need to decide the right time to grow and bloom. Humans also need to decide the right moment for social actions. Although scientists can pinpoint the timing of such behaviors by observation, we know extremely little about how living organisms as actors or players decide when to act – such as the exact moment to dash or pounce. The time measurements of an outsider-observer and the insider-participants are utterly different. We explain how such essential operations of timing adjustment and temporal spanning, both of which constitute a single regulated set, can be carried out among organisms. For this purpose, we have to reexamine the ordinary conception of time. Our specific explanatory tools include the natural movement known as the upbeat (anacrusis) in music, a rhythmic push for the downbeat that follows, which predicts future moves as an anticipatory lead-in. The scheme is situated in and is the extension of our formulation of E-series time, i.e., timing co-adjusted through interaction, which is derived from the semiotic/communicative perspectives. We thereby demonstrate that a prediction-based timing system is not mechanical but communicative and entails meanings for future anticipation.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12304-020-09398-5.pdf,link.springer.com,antthrush,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.02182244930504,,522

It is highly sensitive to human disturbance and habitat change, two threats that are unlikely to be removed soon in present range countries, and that increase the need for long-term continuous effort for in situ conservation. Captive breeding for reintroduction is potentially an important measure for localized population restoration. But green peafowl can hybridize with blue peafowl (P. cristatus) and produce fertile offspring that can backcross with ancestral species. Hybrids backcrossed to green peafowl for a few generations are indistinguishable from pure green peafowl in appearance. Such hybrids must be excluded from captive breeding programs to avoid anthropogenic genetic contamination. In this study, we developed technology to identify hybrids using mitochondrial Cyt b and COI gene sequences, and 16 microsatellites. We studied maternal species assignment for excluding individuals of the blue peafowl maternal line and genetic clustering analysis to exclude individuals containing blue peafowl nuclear genes. Maternal species assignment was accomplished using K2P pairwise genetic distance computed using transition nucleotide substitution. Nuclear genetic clustering analysis was performed using STRUCTURE (assuming K = 2) and NewHybrids. The method was validated using reference pure green (n = 18) and blue (n = 21) peafowl and known hybrids (n = 12). Two criteria were set up to discriminate hybrids based on the probability that an individual is either pure green or pure blue peafowl at 95% confidence.

The reliability of five different DNA barcodes was also assessed to provide further insights into species delineation. The ITS region can resolve the placement of taxa up to the species complex level. The GAPDH and TUB2 markers are determined to be the most informative for most complexes.

By annotating SNPs with the chCADD score we are able to pinpoint specific subregions of the CNEs to be of higher functional importance, as supported by SNPs found in these subregions are associated with known disease genes in humans, mice, and rats. Taken together, our findings indicate that CNEs harbor variants of functional significance that should be object of further investigation along with protein-coding mutations.

The Caribbean is home to over 20 passerine species listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered. The Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi) is listed as critically endangered and is now restricted to Andros, a single island complex in The Bahamas. We investigated this species' habitat use and produced the first statistically robust estimate of population size. We conducted point counts during the Bahama Oriole's breeding season in May and June 2017, extensively surveying the northern part of North Andros over a study area covering 713 km². Hierarchical distance sampling models estimated 1269–2765 individuals within our study area, a substantially larger population on North Andros than was indicated by the previously published estimates. Earlier studies, which disproportionately sampled anthropogenic and coppice habitats, likely underestimated this species' abundance in pine forest. We found that the Bahama Oriole is widespread, most abundant in pine forest, and not dependent on developed habitats during the breeding season. These findings provide a better outlook for the species' persistence and indicate that conserving pine forest would benefit this critically endangered species. Our results also emphasize the importance of rigorously evaluating habitat use when developing conservation plans for endangered species. Systematic population counts and statistical analyses that account for detection probability are needed for endangered and vulnerable endemic birds across the Caribbean, especially in the face of increased hurricane strength and sea level rise due to climate change.
RÉSUMÉ
Les Caraïbes abritent plus de 20 espèces de passereaux classées par l'Union internationale pour la conservation de la nature comme vulnérables, en danger ou en danger critique d'extinction. L'Oriole des Bahamas (Icterus northropi) est classé comme en danger critique d'extinction et est désormais limité à Andros, un complexe insulaire unique des Bahamas. Nous avons étudié l'utilisation de l'habitat de cette espèce et calculé la première estimation statistiquement solide de la taille de la population. Nous avons effectué des dénombrements par points d'écoute pendant la saison de reproduction de cet oriole, en mai et juin 2017, en sillonnant la partie nord d'Andros Nord sur une aire couvrant 713 km². Des modèles hiérarchiques à partir des dénombrements fondés sur la distance ont permis d'établir le nombre d'individus à 1 269-2 765 dans notre aire d'étude, soit une population nettement plus importante sur Andros Nord que ce qui avait été rapporté précédemment. Les études antérieures, qui ont échantillonné de manière disproportionnée les milieux anthropiques et les taillis, ont probablement sous-estimé l'abondance de cette espèce dans les pinèdes. Nous avons constaté que l'Oriole des Bahamas est très répandu, qu'il est le plus abondant dans les pinèdes et qu'il ne dépend pas des milieux anthropiques pendant la saison de reproduction. Ces résultats donnent une meilleure perspective pour la pérennité de cette espèce en danger critique d'extinction et indiquent que la conservation des pinèdes lui serait bénéfique. Nos résultats soulignent également l'importance d'évaluer rigoureusement l'utilisation des habitats lors de l'élaboration de plans de conservation pour les espèces en danger. Des dénombrements de population systématiques et des analyses statistiques qui tiennent compte de la probabilité de détection sont nécessaires pour les oiseaux endémiques en danger et vulnérables dans l'ensemble des Caraïbes, en particulier face à la puissance accrue des ouragans et à l'élévation du niveau de la mer attribuables au changement climatique.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art5/ACE-ECO-2021-1775.pdf,ace-eco.org,lucía,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.04863392787192,"['bahama oriole', 'icterus northropi', 'ou']",443

Here, I present evidence that socially monogamous songbirds perform complex courtship displays that can produce multimodal and multicomponent signals in wild conditions. Cordon-bleus (Uraeginthus spp.) are socially monogamous songbirds from East Africa. Both sexes of cordon-bleus perform multimodal courtship displays by holding a piece of nest material, bobbing up and down, and singing. My previous laboratory study using high-speed video cameras revealed that courtship bobbing includes multiple rapid steps similar to human tap-dancing, which presumably contributes to producing non-vocal sounds and/or vibrations in addition to visual signals. As a result of field observation and behavioral analysis, I found that wild cordon-bleus perform tap-dance like displays just as captive cordon-bleus. I also observed that wild cordon-bleus produced non-vocal sounds and shook branches during courtship, which can contribute to multimodal signal production (i.e., visual, acoustic, and vibrational signals).

Consequently, little is known about pattern-forming events. Here, we surveyed plumage patterns and their emergence in Galliformes, ratites, passerines, and penguins, together representing the three major taxa of the avian phylogeny, and built a unified model that not only reproduces final patterns but also intrinsically generates shared and varying directionality, sequence, and duration of patterning. We used in vivo and ex vivo experiments to test its parameter-based predictions. We showed that directional and sequential pattern progression depends on a species-specific prepattern: an initial break in surface symmetry launches a travelling front of sharply defined, oriented domains with self-organising capacity. This front propagates through the timely transfer of increased cell density mediated by cell proliferation, which controls overall patterning duration. These results show that universal mechanisms combining prepatterning and self-organisation govern the timely emergence of the plumage pattern in birds.",https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000448&type=printable,journals.plos.org,autruche,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.07183814322511,,931

Background: Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are abundant predatory species in many agroecosystems, 
are valued for their biological pest control functions, and have been recommended as test species for studies sup‑
porting the assessment of non‑target effects of insect‑resistant Bt crops. Although insecticidal Bt proteins are known 
to be highly specific against target pests, some recent laboratory studies reported putative toxic effects of Bt proteins 
on ladybird species. While such studies have been criticised because of methodological shortcomings or inconsisten‑
cies, they cast doubt on the insecticidal spectrum of activity of some Bt proteins. Performing a systematic review that 
synthesises all existing evidence on this controversial topic may help to resolve the remaining scientific uncertainties. 
The review question to be addressed by the systematic review is the following: Are ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coc-
cinellidae) affected by Bt proteins expressed in genetically modified insect‑resistant crops? The systematic review will focus 
on studies performed under controlled environmental conditions.
Methods: An extensive literature search will be conducted to identify the articles relevant to the review question. A 
wide range of electronic bibliographic databases, the internet search engine Google Scholar, and websites of special‑
ized organizations will be searched. Citation searching, reference list‑checking and searching of key journals will also 
be performed. The relevance of the identified articles will be assessed against a set of pre‑defined eligibility criteria, 
following a two‑step approach. In the first step, title and abstract (or summary) will be screened, whilst in the second 
step the full text of all remaining articles will be assessed by two members of the review team. All relevant studies 
will be subjected to an appraisal of external (generalisability) and internal (risk of bias) validity. Data from the selected 
studies will be extracted and synthesised in a narrative report. If a sufficient number of datasets generated with com‑
parable experimental setup is available, statistical meta‑analyses will be conducted on a range of comparisons and 
including sensitivity analyses.

that this dependence is mutual, declines in whitebark seed production could cause declines
in nutcracker abundance. Whitebark pine is in decline across much of its range due to inter-
acting stressors, including the non-native pathogen white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribi-
cola J. C. Fisch.). We used avian point-count data and tree surveys from four national park
units to investigate whether trends in whitebark pine can explain trends in Clark’s nut-
cracker. Spatial trends were modeled using recent data from two parks, while temporal
trends were modeled using longer time-series of nutcracker and whitebark data from two
additional parks. To assess the potential dependence of nutcrackers on whitebark, we
linked a model of nutcracker density (accounting for detection probability) with a model of
whitebark trends, using a Bayesian framework to translate uncertainty in whitebark metrics
to uncertainty in nutcracker density. In Mount Rainier National Park, temporal models
showed dramatic declines in nutcracker density concurrent with significant increases in
whitebark crown mortality and trees infected with white pine blister rust. However, nutcrack-
ers did not trend with whitebark metrics in North Cascades National Park Service Complex.
In spatial models of data from Yosemite National Park and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National

Most of the so-called mycoheterotrophic plants exhibit high specificity towards their fungal partners. We tested whether natural rarity of mycoheterotrophic plants and usual small and fluctuating population size make their populations more prone to genetic differentiation caused by restricted gene flow and/or genetic drift. We also tested whether these genetic characteristics might in turn shape divergent fungal preferences. We studied the mycoheterotrophic orchid Epipogium aphyllum, addressing the joint issues of genetic structure of its populations over Europe and possible consequences for mycorrhizal specificity within the associated fungal taxa. Out of 27 sampled E. aphyllum populations, nine were included for genetic diversity assessment using nine nuclear microsatellites and plastid DNA. Population genetic structure was inferred based on the total number of populations. Individuals from 17 locations were included into analysis of genetic identity of mycorrhizal fungi of E. aphyllum based on barcoding by nuclear ribosomal DNA. Epipogium aphyllum populations revealed high genetic diversity (uHe = 0.562) and low genetic differentiation over vast distances (FST = 0.106 for nuclear microsatellites and FST = 0.156 for plastid DNA). Bayesian clustering analyses identified only two genetic clusters, with a high degree of admixture. Epipogium aphyllum genets arise from panmixia and display locally variable, but relatively high production of ramets, as shown by a low value of rarefied genotypic richness (Rr = 0.265). Epipogium aphyllum genotype control over partner selection was negligible as (1) we found ramets from a single genetic individual associated with up to 68% of the known Inocybe spp. associating with the plant species, (2) and partner identity did not show any geographic structure. The absence of mosaicism in the mycorrhizal specificity over Europe may be linked to preferential allogamous habit of E. aphyllum and significant gene flow, which tend to promote host generalism.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10265-021-01364-7.pdf,link.springer.com,tuulik,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-9.09864771856312,,104

Microorganisms are known to be transmitted during mating, especially when mating with multiple partners, and factors reducing this cost of multiple mating are expected. Further, plumage brightness and colour intensity have been shown to be important traits to benefits from multiple mating as predicted by sexual selection. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the rate of extra-pair paternity and the relative size of the uropygial gland at the interspecific level, as the uropygial gland is an exocrine gland hypothesized to produce antiparasitic substances and further identified to affect plumage brightness. Because of the expected benefits of large uropygial gland in scenarios of sexual selection, we predicted a positive correlation with EPP. We collected information from the literature of uropygial gland size and frequency of extra-pair paternity of 60 avian species of different families and explored the predicted positive correlation between them. We did so with means of comparative analyses that considered phylogenetic relationship as random factor and included body mass as covariate. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed models that were weighted by number of nests used to estimate extra-pair paternity. We detected a positive relationship between level of extra-pair paternity and uropygial gland size at an interspecific level. This finding is consistent with the prediction. We discuss the importance of this result in scenarios of sexual selection and argue that the detected relationship may have arisen by utilizing antiparasitic secretions through secondary sexual characters indicating parasite resistance.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00226-5,avianres.biomedcentral.com,d'europe,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.10433712949396,,553

Here, we show that human speech and birdsong share a similar sequential structure indicative of both hierarchical and Markovian organization. We analyze the sequential dynamics of song from multiple songbird species and speech from multiple languages by modeling the information content of signals as a function of the sequential distance between vocal elements. Across short sequence-distances, an exponential decay dominates the information in speech and birdsong, consistent with underlying Markovian processes. At longer sequence-distances, the decay in information follows a power law, consistent with underlying hierarchical processes. Thus, the sequential organization of acoustic elements in two learned vocal communication signals (speech and birdsong) shows functionally equivalent dynamics, governed by similar processes.

Avian haemosporidians comprise more than 250 species traditionally classified into four genera, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Fallisia. However, analyses of the mitochondrial CytB gene revealed a vast variety of lineages not yet linked to morphospecies. This study aimed to analyse and discuss the data of haemosporidian lineages isolated from birds of the family Turdidae, to visualise host and geographic distribution using DNA haplotype networks and to suggest directions for taxonomy research on parasite species. Methods Haemosporidian CytB sequence data from 350 thrushes were analysed for the present study and complemented with CytB data of avian haemosporidians gathered from Genbank and MalAvi database. Maximum Likelihood trees were calculated to identify clades featuring lineages isolated from Turdidae species. For each clade, DNA haplotype networks were calculated and provided with information on host and geographic distribution. Results In species of the Turdidae, this study identified 82 Plasmodium, 37 Haemoproteus, and 119 Leucocytozoon lineages, 68, 28, and 112 of which are mainly found in this host group. Most of these lineages cluster in the clades, which are shown as DNA haplotype networks. The lineages of the Leucocytozoon clades were almost exclusively isolated from thrushes and usually were restricted to one host genus, whereas the Plasmodium and Haemoproteus networks featured multiple lineages also recovered from other passeriform and non-passeriform birds. Conclusion This study represents the first attempt to summarise information on the haemosporidian parasite lineages of a whole bird family. The analyses allowed the identification of numerous groups of related lineages, which have not been linked to morphologically defined species yet, and they revealed several cases in which CytB lineages were probably assigned to the wrong morphospecies.

Although morphological and physiological differences are recognized in flight-degenerate bird species, their contributions to recurrent flight degeneration events across modern birds and underlying genetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, in an analysis of 295 million nucleotides from 48 bird genomes, we identify two convergent sites causing amino acid changes in ATGLSer321Gly and ACOT7Ala197Val in flight-degenerate birds, which to our knowledge have not previously been implicated in loss of flight. Functional assays suggest that Ser321Gly reduces lipid hydrolytic ability of ATGL, and Ala197Val enhances acyl-CoA hydrolytic activity of ACOT7. Modeling simulations suggest a switch of main energy sources from lipids to carbohydrates in flight-degenerate birds. Our results thus suggest that physiological convergence plays an important role in flight degeneration, and anatomical convergence often invoked may not. Flight loss has occurred numerous times in bird evolution. Here, the authors examine convergent sites in the exonic and intronic sequences of 48 bird genomes, finding amino-acid changes in two genes, ATGL and ACOT7, with potential implications for a change in metabolism rather than anatomy.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10682-3.pdf,nature.com,rifleman,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.13991479653116,,1034

These parasites have been reported to have a wide geographic distribution, however, there are no reports of these protists in the Canary Islands, Spain. One of the peculiarities of the life cycle of Adelina spp. is the participation of a predator, because fecundation and sporulation occur inside the body cavity, and so necessitate destruction of the definitive host. The involvement therefore of a ‘dispersion host’, which eats the definitive host and spreads the oocysts through its faeces, is critical for the maintenance of certain Adelina spp. On the island of Gran Canaria, adeleid oocysts have been found in stool samples from four animals, three California kingsnakes (Lampropeltis californiae), and one feral cat. These animals were part of a larger coprological study of vertebrate parasites (117 snakes, 298 cats), where pseudoparasitic elements were also recorded.

Twenty-five populations (286 individuals) of P. lambertii were screened for sequence variation at three intergenic cpDNA loci. We characterized the genetic diversity, constructed a haplotype network, identified population groups based on genetic divergence among populations and putative refugial areas, and tested the association between genetic and geographic distances. For SDMs, we used an ensemble approach based on five algorithms to estimate climatically suitable areas for the species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Holocene (HOL), and the present-day (PD). For all populations, haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0.676 and 4.8 × 10−4, respectively. Neutrality tests indicated a recent expansion for the species. Analysis of molecular variance revealed genetic divergence among populations (FST = 0.1385), significantly correlated with geographic distances (r = 0.524, p < 0.01). Bayesian analysis suggested the formation of a Southern Group (SG) and Northern Group (NG), separated by a barrier to gene flow, with high differentiation among groups (FCT = 0.6458). The SDMs showed temporal changes in an area suitable for P. lambertii, mainly present at high altitudes and cold temperatures.

Secretive marsh birds, including rails and bitterns, have experienced widespread population declines due to the loss of wetland habitat on which they depend. Because of their cryptic behavior, secretive marsh birds are challenging to study and information on their habitat requirements is limited, especially across the full annual cycle. Quantifying habitat associations throughout the annual cycle and at broad geographic scales can advance a more comprehensive approach for secretive marsh bird conservation. The goal of this study was to quantitatively synthesize results from empirical studies that examined species-habitat relationships of secretive marsh birds in the North American Mississippi Flyway to identify general patterns and information gaps that can guide future management and conservation efforts. We performed a meta-analysis and incorporated results from 40 studies that quantitatively assessed habitat associations of American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), King Rail (Rallus elegans), Sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), and Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis). Most studies examined breeding season habitat, whereas only 13% reported on habitat use during migration and none during winter. At landscape scales, breeding marsh birds were positively associated with amount of wetlands, especially in the Great Lakes region, and negatively associated with amount of urban land cover, particularly for American Bittern. At the local scale, breeding marsh birds were positively associated with cattail coverage (Typhaspp) and other robust emergent vegetation. Overall, marsh birds were negatively associated with woody wetland vegetation, although effects were weaker in the Prairie region and varied among species. During autumn migration, moist-soil vegetation coverage was important for rails in the lower Midwest. The habitat use patterns we identified across studies provide a general characterization of marsh bird breeding habitat to aid in landscape-level multi-species conservation efforts. Our study also highlights the immediate research needs for full annual cycle conservation of secretive marsh bird habitat in North America: specifically, information during winter and migration.

The Kea (Nestor notabilis ...,en,The KEA—Progress of Development,"A NOTICE of the development of a striking change in the habits of a bird may be considered by naturalists interesting enough to justify a brief record in your journal. The Kea (Nestor notabilis) may be seen and heard in certain localities amidst the wild scenery of the Southern Alps in the middle island of New Zealand, for it is not so rare as has been described. This fine bird belongs to one of our indigenous genera, an examination of its structure proves that it shares with the Kaka a claim to a position amongst the Trichoglossinæ or Brush-tongued Parrots; the under side of its thick tongue near the tip is fringed with papillæ, enabling it to collect the sweets of its favourite blossoms. Through how many years has this species been content to range over shrub-covered heights and rock-bound gullies, gathering its subsistence from the nectar of hardy flowers, from the drupes and berries of the dwarfed shrubs that contend with a rigorous climate, and Dress upwards almost to the snow line of our Alpine giants? To these food-resources may be added insects found in the crevices of rocks, beneath the bark of trees, and its aliment not wholly vegetarian, yet such as called forth no display of boldness in order to procure a sufficient supply. This peaceful demeanour was observed under the ascendency of Moaic conservatism. The European has been the means of corrupting the simplicity of its ancient habits; the meat-gallows of the back-country squatters attracted the attention of our mountain-parrots in the winter season. To them they became points of interest in their wanderings, and furnished many a hearty meal torn from the dangling carcass as it swung in the frosty air; neither were the drying sheepskins, stretched on the rails of the stockyard, neglected. The Paneka has been destined to supply the enterprising Kea with a dainty only equalled perhaps by that which the epicurean African cuts warm from his bovine victim—our educated bird now tears his food from the back of the living sheep. From a local paper one learns that, for the last three years the sheep belonging to a settler “in the Wanaka district, (Otago) appeared afflicted with what was thought to be a new kind of disease; neighbours and shepherds were equally at a loss to account for it, having never seen anything of the kind before. The first appearance of this supposed disease is a patch of raw flesh on the loin of the sheep, about the size of a man's hand; from this matter continually runs down the side, taking the wool completely off the part it touches, and in many cases death is the result. At last a shepherd noticed one of the mountain parrots sticking to a sheep and pecking at a sore, and that the animal seemed unable to get rid of its tormentor. The runholder gave directions to his shepherds to keep watch on the parrots when mustering on the high ground; the result has been that during the present season when mustering high upon the ranges near the snow line, they saw several of the birds surrounding a sheep which was freshly bleeding from a small wound in the loin; on other sheep were noticed places where the Kea had begun to attack them, small pieces of wool having been picked out.”",,nature.com,kea,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.16816493220128,"['kea', 'kaka', 'nestor notabilis']",1000

Here, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of H9N2 in the Middle East and identified phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations that acted cooperatively to increase H9N2 replication/transcription in human cells. The accumulation of PB2 mutations also correlated with an increase in H9N2 virus growth in the upper and lower airways of mice and in virulence. These mutations clustered on a solvent-exposed region in the PB2-627 domain in proximity to potential interfaces with host factors. These PB2 mutations have been found at high prevalence during evolution of H9N2 in the field, indicating that they have provided a selective advantage for viral adaptation to infect poultry.

Mammalian skin harbours a complex consortium of beneficial microorganisms known to provide health and immune-boosting advantages. As yet, however, little is known about functional microbial communities on avian feathers, including their co-evolution with the host and factors determining feather microbiota (FM) diversity. Using 16S rRNA profiling, we investigated how host species identity, phylogeny and geographic origin determine FM in free-living passerine birds. Moreover, we estimated the relative abundance of bacteriocin-producing bacteria (BPB) and keratinolytic feather damaging bacteria (FDB) and evaluated the ability of BPB to affect FM diversity and relative abundance of FDB. Host species identity was associated with feather bacterial communities more strongly than host geographic origin. FM functional properties differed in terms of estimated BPB and FDB relative abundance, with both showing interspecific variation. FM diversity was negatively associated with BPB relative abundance across species, whereas BPB and FDB relative abundance was positively correlated.

A. acuminatus, the species that is distributed extending to the northern edge of the genus, where the specialized nectarivorous sunbirds are absent, possesses reddish-green flowers and a wide-open corolla tube, flowering time shifts from summer to winter and the species achieves high fruiting success. This atypical flower led us to investigate the pollination biology of this species. Three species of generalist passerines, Grey-cheeked Fulvetta (Alcippe morrisonia, Sylviidae), White-eared Sibia (Heterophasia auricularis, Leiothrichidae) and Taiwan Yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps, Zosteropidae), were recorded visiting A. acuminatus flowers. Pollination effectiveness was quantified via conspecific pollen presence on stigmas and natural fruit set. The significantly high natural fruit set (60%) and conspecific pollen transfer rate (94%) indicate high reproductive success facilitated by the accurate pollen placement on the birds. The existence of copious (61 µL) and highly diluted (7%) hexose-dominant nectar, together with a major reflectance peak of corolla lobe in the long-wavelength red color spectrum, is consistent with the pollination syndrome of generalist passerines. The high pollination effectiveness of A. acuminatus due to the recruitment of generalist passerines as pollinators, and the specializations of floral traits to match generalist bird pollination, appear crucial in the successful colonization on islands such as Taiwan that lack specialized bird pollinators.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53035-2.pdf,nature.com,sibia,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-9.18085931973677,"['taiwan yuhina', 'heterophasia auricularis', 'yuhina brunneiceps', 'alcippe morrisonia']",876

The spectrographical and statistical analysis of coo calls of these two species shows significant differences in frequency traits. Calls of Didunculus are slightly higher than those of Ducula.

It is also widely and commonly used in many cuisines and products in the food industry. However, the anaphylactic reaction caused by mango has long been reported as a major problem for consumption in recent years. To prevent allergens in mango, the best way is to avoid mango in the diet. In this study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the detection of mango in food. Four specifically designed LAMP primers targeting the internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence regions were used to address the LAMP reaction for amplifying mango DNA. The results demonstrated that the detection of mango DNA was specifically validated by the LAMP primer. The sensitivity of LAMP for detecting mango DNA is equivalent to that of the traditional PCR method. The LAMP primer sets showed high specificity for detecting the DNA of mango and had no cross-reactions to other species. Moreover, when mango was mixed with other fruits at different ratios, no cross-reactivity for the detection of mango DNA was manifested during LAMP. Finally, genomic DNAs extracted from different heat-processed mangos were used as templates; the detection of mango DNA by LAMP was not significantly affected and was reproducible. As to this established LAMP herein, mango ingredients can be detected, and commercial foods containing mango can also be identified. This assay will be useful and have potential for the rapid detection of mango DNA in practical food markets.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00217-020-03440-z.pdf,link.springer.com,mango,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-9.20263373625977,,809

One of the major routes of transmission for leptospirosis is the natural environment contaminated with the urine of a wide range of reservoir animals. Soils and surface waters also host a high diversity of non-pathogenic Leptospira and species for which the virulence status is not clearly established. The genus Leptospira is currently divided into 35 species classified into three phylogenetic clusters, which supposedly correlate with the virulence of the bacteria. In this study, a total of 90 Leptospira strains isolated from different environments worldwide including Japan, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Algeria, mainland France, and the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean were sequenced. A comparison of average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of genomes of the 90 isolates and representative genomes of known species revealed 30 new Leptospira species. These data also supported the existence of two clades and 4 subclades. To avoid classification that strongly implies assumption on the virulence status of the lineages, we called them P1, P2, S1, S2. One of these subclades has not yet been described and is composed of Leptospira idonii and 4 novel species that are phylogenetically related to the saprophytes. We then investigated genome diversity and evolutionary relationships among members of the genus Leptospira by studying the pangenome and core gene sets. Our data enable the identification of genome features, genes and domains that are important for each subclade, thereby laying the foundation for refining the classification of this complex bacterial genus. We also shed light on atypical genomic features of a group of species that includes the species often associated with human infection, suggesting a specific and ongoing evolution of this group of species that will require more attention. In conclusion, we have uncovered a massive species diversity and revealed a novel subclade in environmental samples collected worldwide and we have redefined the classification of species in the genus. The implication of several new potentially infectious Leptospira species for human and animal health remains to be determined but our data also provide new insights into the emergence of virulence in the pathogenic species.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007270&type=printable,journals.plos.org,mayotte,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.21142521790417,,1063

Paragalago granti and P. cocos both have incremental calls but are not sister taxa; P. cocos is the sister taxon to P. zanzibaricus, which has a rolling (trilling) call like that of P. rondoensis, one of the outliers to the complex. To test current hypotheses of species delimitation, I conducted 378 playback trials, using conspecific and heterospecific loud calls and recording both vocal responses and movement toward the speaker. To investigate the sensory drive hypothesis (acoustic adaptation), I measured reverberation duration of 215 short “yap” mobbing calls and examined 282 sonotopes (local soundscapes). I tested the hypothesis that different species’ ear lengths allow the animals to filter out interfering frequencies in local background noise. On Zanzibar Island, P. zanzibaricus responded solely to conspecific calls (23/32). In South Africa, P. granti individuals responded to conspecific calls (12/22) but also sometimes to P. cocos calls (9/22). In Kenya, P. cocos individuals responded to conspecific calls (34/40) but also sometimes to P. zanzibaricus calls (8/40). The three habitats showed differences in reverberation duration, and soundscapes differed in background orthopteran frequencies. Incremental calls probably evolved in the ancestor of the complex, in response to high levels of reverberation and a continuous backdrop of katydid stridulation in dry forest. Secondary evolution of trilling and decreased ear size probably evolved as result of decreased reverberation and higher frequency katydid interference in the P. cocos–P. zanzibaricus ancestor.

All major world checklists and authors of monographs on the Caprimulgiformes accept C. centralasicus as a species, but efforts to rediscover it in the field have failed, meaning that occasional doubts have been expressed as to its taxonomic validity. We subjected the holotype of C. centralasicus to a molecular examination and renewed morphological comparisons, with the aim of resolving its status.

There is a high degree of likelihood that C. centralasicus is a synonym of C. e. plumipes, but the small size of the holotype compared to C. europaeus persists in being difficult to fully rationalize, although we believe that the bird is, in fact, a fledgling in its first plumage, parts of which are still growing, which would explain much of the difference.

The Sierra Madre Sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi) is an endangered species microendemic to subalpine grasslands of central and northwestern Mexico. Given that land use change is highly dynamic in central Mexico, there is a need for a continuous monitoring of the distribution and conservation status of the species across the region. We here update the distribution of the Sierra Madre Sparrow by surveying the historical sites where the species is known to occur, verifying records from a citizen science database, and identifying potential habitat in the region to find new localities for the species. We also highlight main local threats and discuss potential conservation activities for the sites where we recorded the species. We found that all historical sites are still inhabited by the species and we identified new localities for the Sierra Madre Sparrow. Each locality presents particular threats for the conservation of the species. Common threats to all sites include agriculture and land owners’ unawareness about the presence of the species. Particular attention should be focused on providing management guidelines for agricultural practices in the area. Special efforts must be directed to engaging communities into conserving and monitoring subalpine grasslands. Much work should be done to define and apply conservation strategies in cooperation with local governments, institutions, and communities. The identification of new localities for the species reveals the need to expand research beyond traditional study and bird-watching sites.
RÉSUMÉ
Le Bruant des sierras (Xenospiza baileyi) est une espèce en voie de disparition microendémique des prairies subalpines du centre et du nord-ouest du Mexique. Le changement dans l'utilisation des terres étant très dynamique dans le centre du Mexique, il importe de faire un suivi continu de la répartition et du statut de conservation de l'espèce dans la région. Nous avons mis à jour la répartition du Bruant des sierras en revisitant les sites historiques de présence de l'espèce, vérifiant les mentions provenant d'une base de données issue de science participative et identifiant des milieux potentiels dans la région afin d'y de trouver de nouveaux sites pour l'espèce. Nous énumérons les menaces locales et décrivons les activités de conservation qu'il est possible de mettre en place aux sites où l'espèce a été observée. Nous avons constaté que tous les sites historiques sont encore occupés par le Bruant des sierras et avons découvert de nouveaux sites de présence. Chaque site présente des menaces particulières pour la conservation de l'espèce. L'agriculture et l'ignorance des propriétaires fonciers quant à la présence de l'espèce sont des menaces communes à tous les sites. Une attention particulière devrait être portée à fournir des directives d'aménagement ciblant les pratiques agricoles dans le secteur. Des efforts spéciaux devraient être destinés aux communautés afin de les engager dans la conservation et le suivi des prairies subalpines. Enfin, il faudrait définir et appliquer les stratégies de conservation en coopération avec les gouvernements, les institutions et les communautés locales.

However, the MHC genetic targets of female mate choice have not been clearly identified, and whether female mate choice is based on neutral genetic characteristics remains an open question. Here, we focus on the effects of morphological traits and genetic similarity among individuals in MHC class IIB (MHC IIB) exon 2 on mating in a sexually dimorphic songbird that exhibits social monogamy with extra-pair paternity (EPP). We sequenced 64 parent–offspring triads sampled over a 3-year period using two MHC class II loci to detect disassortative mating in the Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia). We found that MHC similarity in social pairs was lower than that in random pairs. Extra-pair mate choice according to MHC IIB was observed, in which females’ extra-pair mates had fewer MHC alleles than their within-pair mates, but there was no significant band-sharing between extra-pair sires and potential extra-pair mates. However, the interaction between the MHC diversity of females and that of the social males affected the occurrence of EPP. Our results support the “optimality hypothesis” of MHC-based social and extra-pair choice.

Dispersion is an essential factor in the potential distribution of the species.",en,Effects of future climate change on the geographical distribution of a bird endemic to South American floodplains,"ABSTRACT
Future climate change poses an immediate threat to biodiversity. Species are shifting their geographic distribution in direct response to climate change. Species around the globe are expected to redistribute poleward and/or to high elevations. However, in the Neotropical region, the effects of climate change on species distribution are still unclear. Here, we aimed to infer the current and future geographical distribution of an insectivorous bird species endemic to South American floodplains, the Mato Grosso Antbird (Cercomacra melanaria). We also estimated shifts in the variables of elevation, longitude, latitude, and slope based on forecasting. Current and future distribution in different climate scenarios were predicted using ecological niche modeling (ENM). A non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc test were carried out to determine if dependent variables (elevation, slope, latitude, and longitude) differed between climate scenarios. Our findings suggest that future climate change will have negative effects (range contraction) on the distribution of the Mato Grosso Antbird. The decrease in the species’ geographical range will cause it to shift to higher elevations, latitudes, longitudes, and slopes. The species should tend to disperse toward more suitable areas located in highlands close to wetlands, such as the headwaters of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPB), and toward the Andean highlands. However, this species inhabits strictly forested environments covering a small home range and its mobility capacity is limited. It is possible that the species will not be able to achieve future geographical redistribution, thus increasing its risk of extinction.
RÉSUMÉ
Les futurs changements climatiques constituent une menace immédiate pour la biodiversité. Les espèces modifient leur répartition géographique en réaction directe aux changements climatiques. On s'attend à ce que les espèces du monde entier se redistribuent vers les pôles ou les hautes altitudes. Cependant, dans la région Néotropicale, les effets des changements climatiques sur la répartition des espèces ne sont toujours pas clairs. Dans le présent article, nous avons tenté de déduire la répartition géographique actuelle et future d'une espèce d'oiseau insectivore endémique des plaines inondables d'Amérique du Sud, le Grisin du Mato Grosso (Cercomacra melanaria). Nous avons également calculé les changements sur le plan des variables d'altitude, de longitude, de latitude et de pente en fonction des prévisions. La répartition actuelle et future selon différents scénarios climatiques a été prédite en utilisant la modélisation de niche écologique (MNÉ). Nous avons réalisé un test non paramétrique de Kruskall-Wallis, puis un test post hoc de Dunn, pour déterminer si les variables dépendantes (altitude, pente, latitude et longitude) différaient entre les scénarios climatiques. Nos résultats indiquent que les futurs changements climatiques auront des effets négatifs (contraction de l'aire) sur la répartition du Grisin du Mato Grosso. La contraction de l'aire de l'espèce se traduira par des déplacements vers des altitudes, des latitudes, des longitudes et des pentes plus élevées. Nous nous attendons à ce que l'espèce ait tendance à se disperser vers des zones plus propices situées dans les hautes terres près de milieux humides, comme les sources du bassin supérieur du fleuve Paraguay (BSP), et vers les hautes terres andines. Toutefois, cette espèce fréquente des environnements strictement forestiers, a un petit domaine vital et une capacité limitée de se déplacer. Il est donc possible que l'espèce ne soit pas en mesure de se redistribuer géographiquement dans le futur, augmentant du même coup son risque de disparition.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art29/ACE-ECO-2021-1893.pdf,ace-eco.org,chaco-finch,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.25186164218491,"['cercomacra melanaria', 'mato grosso antbird', 'ou']",140

The conditions encountered during the migratory period, particularly at stopover sites, can influence individual survival, reproductive success, and population stability; therefore, knowledge of migration ecology is important for developing conservation strategies. We monitored stopover site use by Reddish Egrets (Egretta rufescens) marked with satellite transmitters between their breeding area in southern Texas, USA, and wintering sites in Mexico and El Salvador. The duration of time spent at stopover sites varied among individuals and seasons, ranging from 1 to 64 days at a particular site. Three of the four individuals that were tracked for multiple seasons flew farther between stopover sites during autumn migration compared to spring, and the average distance between stopovers ranged from 192 to 580 km among individuals. Laguna San Andres in Tamaulipas, Mexico, appeared to be the most important stopover site based on the proportion of the marked population that used it. Understanding the stopover ecology and habitat use of migratory individuals will help direct conservation efforts for the species.

Despite a generalist life history and a widespread distribution, the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) has declined by more than 58% since 1970. In Illinois, where this study was conducted, the current rate of decline is 7.03% annually. We hypothesized that low reproductive success in intensely agricultural areas is driving population decline. To test this, we quantified the nesting success and post-fledging survival of Common Grackles in central Illinois. Over a 2-year period, we monitored 188 nests and tracked the survival of 53 fledglings. Our estimate for nesting success of 0.622 (95% CI: 0.549-0.695) was much higher than the literature average of 0.267. Similarly, although post-fledging survival had not been estimated previously for Common Grackles, our estimate of 0.617 (95% CI: 0.471-0.764) was relatively high compared to that of other songbirds (range: 0.23-0.87). The most important factor influencing these estimates was ordinal date, which had a negative relationship with both nesting success and post-fledging survival. These results suggest that reproductive success is not the primary driver of population decline in Illinois. To expand upon the field portion of our study, we constructed a demographic model and used it to conduct a global sensitivity analysis. In our model, adult survival was the most influential demographic parameter in the context of population change. This study serves as an initial step in understanding the mechanism(s) of decline in the Common Grackle. We recommend additional research on the survival of Common Grackles, particularly in relation to persecution on the wintering grounds and exposure to agricultural chemicals.

eastern buzzard (Buteo japonicus), and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Our extensive genomic analysis and
comparisons with non-raptor genomes identify common molecular signatures that underpin anatomical structure
and sensory, muscle, circulatory, and respiratory systems related to a predatory lifestyle. Compared with diurnal
birds, owls exhibit striking adaptations to the nocturnal environment, including functional trade-offs in the sensory
systems, such as loss of color vision genes and selection for enhancement of nocturnal vision and other sensory
systems that are convergent with other nocturnal avian orders. Additionally, we find that a suite of genes
associated with vision and circadian rhythm are differentially expressed in blood tissue between nocturnal and

(2010) in Sweden, who found that mink populations tripled as fox populations declined due to an outbreak of sarcoptic mange, and ...",en,The effect of top predator removal on the distribution of a mesocarnivore and nest survival of an endangered shorebird,"ABSTRACT
For trophic systems regulated by top-down processes, top carnivores may determine species composition of lower trophic levels. Removal of top predators could therefore cause a shift in community composition. If predators play a role in limiting the population of endangered prey animals, removing carnivores may have unintended consequences for conservation. Lethal predator removal to benefit prey species is a widely used management strategy. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a common nest predator of threatened piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) and are often the primary target of predator removal programs, yet predation remains the number one cause of piping plover nest loss. Predator exclusion cages (hereafter, exclosures) around nests are often used to keep foxes from eating eggs, as an alternative to predator removal. Fox removals may increase the presence or activity of smaller predators, including American mink (Neovison vison), which can enter exclosures. We predicted that when foxes were removed from plover breeding sites, mesopredator release of mink would occur and lead to increased predation levels of plover nests. Average probability of mink occupancy was higher when foxes were absent (0.26 [95% BCI = 0.16, 0.38]) than when they were present (0.04 [0.01, 0.09]). For nests not protected by exclosures, nest predation was similar at sites with (0.42 [0.12, 0.68]) and without foxes (0.38 [0.10, 0.64]). At sites where foxes were absent, however, predation rates of exclosed nests were 3-fold higher (foxes absent [0.25 {0.06, 0.52}]) compared to sites where foxes remained [0.06 {0.01, 0.18}]). Our results suggest that removal of foxes from plover breeding sites allowed American mink to expand their local range. In turn, removal of foxes led to a decrease in nest survival of an endangered ground-nesting bird. Conservation within complex trophic systems may fail if interactions among species are not well understood when implementing lethal predator removal.
RÉSUMÉ
Dans les systèmes trophiques régulés par des processus descendants, les carnivores de niveaux trophiques supérieurs peuvent déterminer la composition des espèces des niveaux trophiques inférieurs. L'élimination des supraprédateurs pourrait donc entraîner une modification de la composition des communautés. Si les prédateurs jouent un rôle dans la restriction de la population de proies menacées, l'élimination des carnivores peut avoir des conséquences inattendues pour la conservation. L'élimination des prédateurs par voie létale au profit des espèces proies est une stratégie de gestion largement utilisée. Le Renard roux (Vulpes vulpes) est un prédateur commun des nids de Pluviers siffleurs (Charadrius melodus), une espèce menacée, et il fait souvent l'objet de programmes d'élimination, mais la prédation reste la cause première de destruction des nids des pluviers. Les cages d'exclusion de prédateurs (ci-après, les exclos) installées autour des nids sont souvent utilisées pour empêcher les renards de manger les oeufs, comme alternative à l'élimination des prédateurs. L'élimination des renards peut entraîner l'augmentation de la présence ou de l'activité de prédateurs plus petits, dont le Vison d'Amérique (Neovison vison), qui peut entrer dans les exclos. Nous avons prédit que lorsque les renards étaient éliminés des sites de nidification des pluviers, une hausse des mésoprédateurs, les visons, se produirait et conduirait à une augmentation de la prédation des nids de pluviers. La probabilité moyenne d'occurrence du vison était plus élevée lorsque les renards étaient absents (0,26 [95 % ICB = 0,16, 0,38]) que lorsqu'ils étaient présents (0,04 [0,01, 0,09]). Pour les nids non protégés par des exclos, la prédation était similaire sur les sites avec (0,42 [0,12, 0,68]) ou sans renards (0,38 [0,10, 0,64]). Cependant, aux sites où les renards étaient absents, le taux de prédation des nids avec exclos était 3 fois plus élevé (renards absents [0,25 {0,06, 0,52}]) qu'aux sites où les renards étaient présents [0,06 {0,01, 0,18}]). Nos résultats indiquent que l'élimination des renards des sites de nidification du pluvier a permis aux visons d'étendre leur aire de répartition locale. Du coup, l'élimination des renards a entraîné une diminution de la survie des nids d'un oiseau en voie de disparition et nichant au sol. La conservation au sein de systèmes trophiques complexes peut échouer si les interactions entre les espèces ne sont pas bien comprises au moment de la mise en oeuvre de l'élimination des prédateurs par voie létale.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art8/ACE-ECO-2021-1806.pdf,ace-eco.org,crab-plover,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.30052897443232,"['charadrius melodus', 'piping plover', 'ou']",415

Background: The behavioural repertoire of every species evolved over time and its evolution can be traced through 
the phylogenetic relationships in distinct groups. Cranes (family Gruidae) represent a small, old, monophyletic group 
with well-corroborated phylogenetic relationships on the species level, and at the same time they exhibit a complex 
and well-described behavioural repertoire.
Methods: We therefore investigated the evolution of behavioural traits of cranes in a phylogenetic context using 
several phylogenetic approaches and two types of trait scoring. The cranes exhibit more than a hundred behavioural 
displays, almost one third of which may be phylogenetically informative.
Results: More than half of the analysed traits carry a significant phylogenetic signal. The ancestor of cranes already 
exhibited a quite complex behavioural repertoire, which remained unchanged in Balearicinae but altered greatly in 
Gruinae, specifically by the shedding of traits rather than their creation. Trait scoring has an influence on results within 
the Gruinae, primarily in genera Bugeranus and Anthropoides.
Conclusions: Albeit the behavioural traits alone cannot be used for resolving species-level relationships within the 
Gruidae, when optimized on molecular tree, they can help us to detect interesting evolutionary transformations of 
behaviour repertoire within Gruiformes. The Limpkin (Aramus guarauna) seems to be the most enigmatic species and 
should be studied in detail for its behavioural repertoire, which may include some precursors of crane behavioural 
traits.

The evolutionary relationships of bird species remain a contentious issue. Richard Prum et al. used targeted genomic sequencing to compare more than 259 nuclear loci from each of 198 living bird species, representing all major avian lineages and two crocodilian outgroups. The results favour a phylogeny consisting of five major clades forming successive sister taxa to the rest of Neoaves, and do not support two recently proposed Neoavian clades — Columbea and Passerea — as natural groups. Although reconstruction of the phylogeny of living birds has progressed tremendously in the last decade, the evolutionary history of Neoaves—a clade that encompasses nearly all living bird species—remains the greatest unresolved challenge in dinosaur systematics. Here we investigate avian phylogeny with an unprecedented scale of data: &gt;390,000 bases of genomic sequence data from each of 198 species of living birds, representing all major avian lineages, and two crocodilian outgroups. Sequence data were collected using anchored hybrid enrichment, yielding 259 nuclear loci with an average length of 1,523 bases for a total data set of over 7.8 × 107 bases. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses yielded highly supported and nearly identical phylogenetic trees for all major avian lineages. Five major clades form successive sister groups to the rest of Neoaves: (1) a clade including nightjars, other caprimulgiforms, swifts, and hummingbirds; (2) a clade uniting cuckoos, bustards, and turacos with pigeons, mesites, and sandgrouse; (3) cranes and their relatives; (4) a comprehensive waterbird clade, including all diving, wading, and shorebirds; and (5) a comprehensive landbird clade with the enigmatic hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) as the sister group to the rest. Neither of the two main, recently proposed Neoavian clades—Columbea and Passerea1—were supported as monophyletic.

As expected, dissolved total mercury (THg) and MeHg concentrations increased linearly with DOC. However, mercury concentrations in fish and invertebrates varied non-linearly, with maximum bioaccumulation at intermediate DOC concentrations, which suggests that MeHg bioavailability may be reduced at high levels of DOC. Further, MeHg and THg concentrations in invertebrates and fish, respectively, increased with δ15N (suggesting trophic position) but were not associated with δ13C.

Noise is an increasingly common component of the natural world, due in large part to human activity. Anthropogenic noise negatively impacts abundance, health, and reproduction in many songbird populations. A few studies have reported altered abundance at larger scales. But whether continental trends are being detected at banding stations, which also offer data on productivity and survivorship, is unknown. Further, it is not known whether localized trends correlate with population trends observed at larger scales. We used breeding season data from 1160 constant-effort banding stations (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship; MAPS) and a spatially explicit noise model to determine whether abundance and productivity were related to mean noise level or spatial heterogeneity (SD) in noise within a 1-km station radius for 72 passerine species. We also determined whether particular life history traits were predictive of noise responses, and compared continental results to those from local studies. Increasing mean noise level was associated with declines in abundance for 27.1% of species and productivity in 22.1% species. Increasing heterogeneity was associated with declines in abundance for 14.3% species and productivity in 14.7% species. The relationship between noise and abundance was not correlated with the relationship between noise and productivity, and acoustic and life history traits were not related to noise responses. Continental results were similar to localized data in 43.1% and 21.4% of species for abundance and productivity, respectively. Although some patterns differed between the local and continental scale, our results indicate that the MAPS banding dataset is capable of detecting noise-associated impacts on abundance and productivity. This is currently the only large-scale dataset capable of quantifying the relationship between noise and productivity in the continental USA, although other datasets exist elsewhere that may also contribute to our understanding of noise impacts at the larger scale.
RÉSUMÉ
Le bruit est une composante de plus en plus courante du monde naturel et causé en grande partie par l'activité humaine. Le bruit d'origine anthropique a un impact négatif sur l'abondance, la santé et la reproduction de nombreuses populations d'oiseaux chanteurs. Quelques études ont fait état d'une diminution d'abondance à plus grande échelle. On ignore si des tendances continentales sont détectées aux stations de baguage, lesquelles fournissent également des données sur la productivité et la survie. De plus, on ne sait pas si les tendances locales sont corrélées aux tendances de populations observées à plus grande échelle. Nous avons utilisé les données en saison de reproduction issues de 1160 stations de baguage à effort constant (programme « Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship »; MAPS) et un modèle de bruit spatialement explicite pour déterminer si l'abondance et la productivité étaient liées au niveau de bruit moyen ou à l'hétérogénéité spatiale (SD) du bruit dans un rayon d'1 km de la station pour 72 espèces de passereaux. Nous avons également déterminé si des traits particuliers du cycle de vie étaient prédictifs des réactions au bruit, et nous avons comparé les résultats continentaux à ceux d'études locales. L'augmentation du niveau de bruit moyen a été associée à une diminution de l'abondance chez 27,1 % des espèces et de la productivité chez 22,1 % des espèces. Une hétérogénéité croissante a été associée à des baisses d'abondance chez 14,3 % des espèces et des baisses de productivité chez 14,7 % des espèces. La relation entre le bruit et l'abondance n'a pas été corrélée avec la relation entre le bruit et la productivité, et les caractéristiques acoustiques et du cycle de vie n'ont pas été liées aux réactions au bruit. Les résultats à l'échelle continentale étaient similaires aux données à l'échelle locale chez 43,1 % et 21,4 % des espèces pour l'abondance et la productivité, respectivement.

We exploited this phenomenon to find candidate loci underlying resistance to the emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis), the United States’ most costly invasive forest insect to date, within the pan-genome of ash trees (the genus Fraxinus). We show that EAB-resistant taxa occur within three independent phylogenetic lineages. In genomes from these resistant lineages, we detect 53 genes with evidence of convergent amino acid evolution. Gene-tree reconstruction indicates that, for 48 of these candidates, the convergent amino acids are more likely to have arisen via independent evolution than by another process such as hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting. Seven of the candidate genes have putative roles connected to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and 17 relate to herbivore recognition, defence signalling or programmed cell death. Evidence for loss-of-function mutations among these candidates is more frequent in susceptible species than in resistant ones. Our results on evolutionary relationships, variability in resistance, and candidate genes for defence response within the ash genus could inform breeding for EAB resistance, facilitating ecological restoration in areas invaded by this beetle.

The drug resistance rate of the isolates from southern China was higher than those from northern China. The E. coli samples collected for migratory birds in the Pearl River Basin had the highest proportion (46.7%) MDR isolates. Furthermore, MDR bacteria carried by migratory birds were closely related to the antibiotic content in the basin, which confirms that MDR bacteria carried by migratory birds are likely acquired from the environment. This study also confirmed that migratory birds are potential transmitters of MDR bacteria, demonstrating the need to reduce the use and emission of antibiotics and further in-depth studies on the mechanisms underlying drug resistance of bacteria.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261444&type=printable,journals.plos.org,étoilé,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-9.42730777298032,,126

Biological invasions occur when individuals of alien species establish and colonize new locations. The House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most widespread invasive birds, native to Eurasia and North Africa, and has successfully invaded many regions from across the world. The House Sparrow was successfully introduced in 1852 into North America and quickly invaded most of the North American continent, except the Florida Peninsula. Currently, the species is found throughout agricultural and urban landscapes of North America except the Yucatan Peninsula. We analyzed the invasion process of the House Sparrow in order to determine why it is absent from the Yucatan Peninsula. For this, we focused our assessment on historical records of the species together with climatic variables. Using an ordination analysis, we compared the climatic space of the North American records for the House Sparrow with that of the Yucatan Peninsula, as well as those before and after the Florida Peninsula invasion, which took sparrows longer to fully colonize. We found that climate may represent an important driver in the process of invasion in the North American invasion of House Sparrows, probably delaying the Florida invasion, and so far, preventing the Yucatan Peninsula invasion. Our results suggest that the absence of the House Sparrow in the Yucatan Peninsula could be a temporal delay, as occurred in the Florida Peninsula; yet, climatic conditions in the Yucatan Peninsula show important differences from those of the Florida Peninsula. Given the species' plasticity and generalist life history traits, it is possible that the House Sparrow may overcome present climatic restrictions and invade the Yucatan Peninsula if proper management is not set in action.
RÉSUMÉ
Les invasions biologiques se produisent lorsque des individus d'espèces étrangères s'établissent et colonisent de nouveaux territoires. Natif d'Eurasie et d'Afrique du Nord, le moineau domestique (Passer domesticus) est l'un des oiseaux invasifs les plus répandus et a envahi avec succès de nombreuses régions du monde. Le moineau domestique a été introduit avec succès en Amérique du Nord en 1852 et a rapidement envahi la plus grande partie du continent nord-américain, à l'exception de la péninsule de Floride. Cette espèce est actuellement présente dans tous les paysages agricoles et urbains d'Amérique du Nord, à l'exception de la péninsule du Yucatan. Nous avons analysé le processus d'invasion du moineau domestique afin de déterminer les raisons de son absence dans la péninsule du Yucatan. Pour ce faire, nous avons concentré notre évaluation sur les dossiers historiques de l'espèce ainsi que sur les variables climatiques. Par une analyse d'ordination, nous avons comparé l'espace climatique des registres d'Amérique du Nord concernant le moineau domestique avec celui de la péninsule du Yucatan, ainsi que ceux qui ont précédé et suivi l'invasion de la péninsule de Floride, où la colonisation du moineau domestique a demandé plus de temps. Nous avons constaté que le climat pourrait constituer un facteur majeur du processus d'invasion de l'Amérique du Nord par le moineau domestique, ce qui a probablement retardé l'invasion de la Floride et jusqu'à présent, a empêché l'invasion de la péninsule du Yucatan. Nos résultats suggèrent que l'absence de moineaux domestiques dans la péninsule du Yucatan pourrait résulter d'un retard temporaire, comme ce fut le cas dans la péninsule de Floride ; pourtant, les conditions climatiques dans la péninsule du Yucatan présentent d'importantes différences par rapport à celles de la péninsule de Floride. Compte tenu de la plasticité de l'espèce et des caractéristiques historiques de la vie généraliste, il est possible que le moineau domestique parvienne à surmonter les restrictions climatiques actuelles et à envahir la péninsule du Yucatan si une gestion adéquate n'est pas mise en place.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art18/ACE-ECO-2021-1835.pdf,ace-eco.org,majeur,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.43744122968397,"['moineau domestique', 'house sparrow', 'passer domesticus']",354

For migratory species such as Black Scoters (Melanitta americana) whose range encompasses a variety of habitats, it is especially important to obtain habitat use information across the species’ range to better understand anthropogenic threats, e.g., marine development and climate change. The objective of our study was to investigate the winter movement patterns and habitat use of Black Scoters in the Atlantic Ocean by quantifying the following key movement indices: number of wintering sites, arrival and departure dates to and from the wintering grounds, days at a wintering site, area of a wintering site, distance between wintering sites, and differences in habitat features of wintering sites. We also tested if winter movement patterns varied by sex or along a latitudinal gradient. To quantify winter movement patterns of Black Scoters, we used satellite telemetry data from 2009 to 2012 (n = 29 tagged females and 15 males for a total of 66 winter seasons, 38 female winter seasons, 28 male winter seasons). Our results indicated that the average wintering site area and distance between wintering sites varied with latitude. Wintering sites located at southern latitudes were larger and further apart than wintering sites located at more northern latitudes. Additionally, wintering sites varied in bathymetry, distance to shore, and the slope of the ocean floor at different latitudes; northern wintering sites were in deeper waters, closer to shore, and on steeper slopes than southern wintering sites. Our results suggest that habitat use may differ by latitude, indicating that habitats used in northern locations may not be representative of habitats used in more southern wintering areas. Understanding variation of habitat use along a latitudinal gradient will enable managers to focus sampling effort for Black Scoter abundance and distribution along the Atlantic coast and provide insight on the wintering ecology and movement of Black Scoters.

We performed structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy. The VM proteins were identified and compared to the best-known chicken VM proteins. According to our results, VM of both species has a typical three-layered structure: the outer layer, inner layer, and the continuous membrane between them. An unusual observation was the finding of “convexity” formed by the inner layer in blackbird. The role of these convex structures is not known, but they can be typical for the species and can be used in their identification. In addition, we identified two proteins in the VM of both species of birds, of which U3KEZ1 FICAL was not previously identified in any other bird species, and the U3JXV8 FICAL protein was confirmed only once in cockatiel parrot VM. The function of these proteins is not exactly known, but their structure shows similarities to the SERPIN proteins that are involved in microbiological defense, i.e., they are immune proteins. This study contributes to the current knowledge about the structure and composition of proteins of VM, especially because similar analyses have never been performed for Turdidae family.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the candid editorial by Keith
Hobson (Hobson 2021) where he thoughtfully explored the
misguided genesis of the province-wide Double-crested
Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) cull instituted in Ontario,
Canada, in 2020. The editorial was aptly published in an avian
conservation journal and was authored by an expert in avian
ecology. At the end of the editorial Hobson welcomed lucid,
evidence-based rebuttals. As a fish ecologist there is nothing in
the article that I wish to rebut. Rather, I wish to amplify the
message and do so from the perspective of the fish. Much of the
commentary, news, and advocacy arising from this issue has come
from those with deep expertise and connections to birds. Yet, given
that the primary reason given for the cull tends to be rooted in
fisheries science, it only makes sense that the fisheries science
community also weighs in. I am also a strong advocate for
evidence-based conservation and environmental management,

notably absent. Below I make four key points.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art16/ACE-ECO-2021-2017.pdf,ace-eco.org,serre,2022-04-09,0,1,1,1,1,-9.44368750866664,"['cormorant', 'phalacrocorax auritus']",196

We examined the effects of immediate capture and 24-h captivity on body mass, body condition, plasma CORT, and metabolite levels including glucose (Glu), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), uric acid (UA), in breeding Eurasian Tree Sparrows (Passer montanus). CORT and Glu levels were increased significantly by the stress of capture, whereas TC and UA levels decreased. Body mass, body condition declined notably after 24 h in captivity, but CORT, Glu, and UA levels increased. Furthermore, male sparrows had lower TG levels after both capture and captivity than those of females. The relationships between plasma CORT and metabolite levels varied between sexes.

Carnivore coprolites are a valuable source of paleoecological and paleoparasitological information. The rock shelter Gruta del Indio (GI) is an emblematic archeological and paleontological site located from Mendoza, Argentina. Several studies were conducted at this site, which provided a stratified sequence spanning the last ∼31 ky BP. The aim of this work was to study parasite remains found in coprolites assigned to carnivores from GI, with the purpose of contributing to the paleoecological knowledge of the site. Twenty coprolites were examined for parasites. Samples were rehydrated in a 0.5% water solution of trisodium phosphate, then homogenized, filtered, and processed by spontaneous sedimentation. The macroscopic remains were separated and dried at room temperature and were examined for diet analysis. All micromammal prey belonged to the Order Rodentia, and six histricomorphs could be identified. Also, bird bones, plant, arthropod, and hair remains were found. Five coprolites contained parasite remains, and eight nematode species were recovered. This is the first paleoparasitological study at this site, and the findings broaden the knowledge of the biogeographic history of the gastrointestinal helminths found. The obtained results evidence the importance of carnivore coprolite studies recovered from archeological contexts in the reconstruction of paleoecological scenarios. Also, the importance of carnivores for the dispersion of their own parasites and the parasites of their prey are discussed.

Conservation of migratory species depends on an understanding of the drivers causing population declines across the annual cycle. Since it is difficult to track the entire annual cycle for long-distance migrants, measurements from part of the cycle may provide insights into overall drivers. Barn Swallows(Hirundo rustica)in Canada have undergone steep and long-term population declines. Using Breeding Bird Survey data and breeding performance data collected at field sites in three regions across Canada, we examined long- and short-term Barn Swallow population trends in Canada, differences in breeding performance across regions, if average breeding performance measures or colony size predicted regional population growth rates and if local breeding performance is driven by density dependence and/or recruitment. We found that long-term negative population trends were generally stronger in the east and west, and weaker in central Canada. Short-term population trends were generally weakly negative or neutral. Average breeding performance and colony size were poor predictors of regional growth rates observed in the subsequent year. We found little support for density dependence affecting local breeding performance; however, local breeding success, presumably through subsequent recruitment of young, was positively correlated to changes in local colony size in the following year. Since we found juveniles recruited into colonies located in the same region, but no link between average breeding performance and estimated regional population trajectories, our results suggest that extrapolating from local-scale studies to broader populations is challenging, and other demographic rates (i.e., survival) may need to be considered. Overall, our study suggests that contemporary Barn Swallow populations are below carrying capacity in Canada, further suggesting that food limitation is not currently regulating populations. Further study is needed to understand what factors are limiting and regulating Barn Swallow populations in Canada, across the annual cycle.
RÉSUMÉ
La conservation des espèces migratrices requiert une bonne compréhension des éléments qui provoquent le déclin des populations sur l'ensemble du cycle annuel. Comme il est difficile de suivre l'intégralité du cycle annuel dans le cas des espèces migratrices parcourant de longues distances, les mesures réalisées sur certaines parties du cycle pourraient fournir des informations au sujet des raisons globales de cette évolution. Au Canada, les populations d'hirondelles rustiques ont connu un déclin vertigineux et durable. En utilisant les données de l'enquête sur la reproduction des oiseaux et les données de performance reproductrice collectées sur le terrain dans trois régions du Canada, nous avons examiné les tendances à long et à court terme des populations d'hirondelles rustiques au Canada, les différences en termes de reproduction entre les régions, la comparaison entre la performance reproductrice moyenne ou la taille des colonies et le taux de croissance prévu des populations régionales et les effets éventuels de la dépendance de la densité et/ou du recrutement sur la performance reproductrice locale. Nous avons constaté que les tendances négatives à long terme étaient généralement plus fortes dans l'est et dans l'ouest, et plus faibles au centre du Canada. Les tendances à court terme des populations étaient généralement légèrement négatives ou neutres. La performance reproductrice moyenne et la taille des colonies étaient de mauvais indicateurs des taux de croissance régionaux observés au cours de l'année suivante. Peu de signes indiquent que la dépendance de la densité affecte la performance reproductrice locale ; toutefois, le succès de la reproduction locale, éventuellement par le recrutement ultérieur de jeunes, semble aboutir à des évolutions positives de la taille des colonies locales au cours de l'année suivante. Dans la mesure où nous avons trouvé des jeunes qui avaient été recrutés dans des colonies installées dans la même région, mais aucun lien entre la performance reproductrice moyenne locale et l'évolution estimée de la population régionale, nos résultats suggèrent que l'extrapolation à partir d'études à échelle locale sur les populations plus larges est difficile, et qu'il faut tenir compte d'autres facteurs démographiques (par ex. le taux de survie). Globalement, notre étude indique que les populations contemporaines d'hirondelles rustiques se situent sous la capacité biotique au Canada, ce qui suggère également que les limites de ressources alimentaires ne régulent pas actuellement les populations. D'autres études sont nécessaires pour comprendre les facteurs qui limitent et régulent les populations d'hirondelles rustiques au Canada, tout au long du cycle annuel.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art10/ACE-ECO-2021-1933.pdf,ace-eco.org,salvadori,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-9.45719294266157,"['hirundo rustica', 'barn swallow', 'ou']",262

Many marsh passerines are cataloged as threatened taxa, mostly due to their high degree of specialization and the generalized deterioration of wetlands worldwide. In this context, habitat selection studies are a very helpful tool to achieve optimal wetland management, take appropriate conservation measures, and avoid potential conservation conflicts resulting from species-specific habitat requirements. For this purpose, we analyzed the population trends and habitat requirements of the threatened marsh passerine community inhabiting a protected Mediterranean wetland with persistent hydrological problems due to aquifer overexploitation. Listening points were conducted yearly for eight consecutive years (2012-2019), and habitat categorization and abundance estimation of the target species (Great Reed Warbler,Acrocephalus arundinaceus; Moustached Warbler,Acrocephalus melanopogon; Reed Bunting,Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi; Savi's Warbler,Locustella luscinioides; Bearded Tit,Panurus biarmicus) were performed at each point. Our results show that the populations of the Great Reed Warbler strongly declined during the study period while those of the Reed Bunting increased; the remaining species experienced an initial increase in abundance but have declined in recent years. The habitat type, measured as relative cover of common reed, saw sedge, bulrush, dry vegetation, open water, and dry surface was important to explain variations in the marsh passerine community structure. Focal species showed different, and even opposite, habitat requirements over the course of eight years, but the abundance of all species seem to be conditioned by disturbances in the wetland water regime. Conservation implications, including the importance of wetland hydrological regime and the presence of heterogeneous environments, are discussed in order to provide relevant information for the conservation of the marsh passerine communities of Mediterranean wetlands.
RÉSUMÉ
De nombreux passereaux des marais sont catalogués comme des espèces menacées, principalement en raison de leur degré de spécialisation élevé et de la détérioration généralisée des zones humides dans le monde entier. Dans ce contexte, les études sur la sélection de l'habitat constituent un outil précieux pour parvenir à une gestion optimale des zones humides, prendre des mesures de conservation appropriées et éviter les conflits potentiels de conservation résultant des exigences d'un habitat spécifique à une espèce. À cette fin, nous avons analysé les tendances des populations et les exigences d'habitat de la communauté de passereaux des marais menacée habitant une zone humide méditerranéenne protégée connaissant des problèmes hydrologiques persistants dus à la surexploitation des aquifères. Des points d'écoute ont été mis en place chaque année pendant huit années consécutives (2012-2019) et la catégorisation des habitats et l'estimation de l'abondance des espèces ciblées (Rousserolle turdoïde, Acrocephalus arundinaceus ; Lusciniole à moustaches, Acrocephalus melanopogon ; Bruant des roseaux, Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi ; Locustelle luscinioïde, Locustella luscinioides ; Panure à moustaches, Panurus biarmicus) a été réalisée sur chaque point. Nos résultats indiquent que les populations de rousserolles turdoïdes ont fortement décliné pendant la période de l'étude, alors que celles de bruant des roseaux ont augmenté ; les autres espèces ont connu une augmentation initiale de leur population, laquelle a ensuite décliné au cours des dernières années. Le type d'habitat, mesuré en tant que couverture relative de roseaux communs, de carex, de joncs, de végétation sèche, de pièces d'eau et de surfaces sèches, était important pour expliquer les variations de la structure des communautés de passereaux des marais. Les espèces observées ont présenté des exigences différentes, voire opposées en termes d'habitat au fil des huit années considérées, mais l'abondance de toutes les espèces semble être conditionnée par les perturbations du régime hydrologique des marais.

Slight secretion on the middle part of the lip is puzzling. The presence of other potential pollinators has not been reported. Based on the results of this study, we confirmed that the flowers of O. fulgens meet all criteria of ornithophily and thus that the hypothesis about bird pollination in the subtribe Maxillariinae is proven.

To date, no standardized protocol is available that would permit to assess sperm kinetic characteristics in passerine birds and this lack precludes any comparison of sperm swimming ability and sperm quality across species. In this study, we chose the Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) as the object to evaluate sperm motility parameters, including sperm motility, sperm velocity and sperm movement trajectory, at different analysis time, temperatures and pH using the WLJY-9000 CASA system. Sperm motility parameters remained statistically unchanged at 1‒9 min. Progressive motility was similar at 38 °C and 40 °C, but a greater percentage of slow progressive sperm was detected at 38 °C compared to 40 °C and 42 °C. Additionally, progressive motility was lower and immotility was higher at 42 °C than 38 °C and/or 40 °C (close to the body temperature of the Tree Sparrow). The percentages of rapid progressive sperm, progressive sperm and immotile sperm were statistically similar at pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 with the exception of lower percentage of progressive sperm at pH 7.0 compared to pH 7.5. In addition, slower sperm velocity and worse sperm movement trajectory were found at pH 6.0 and 9.0 than those at pH 8.0, 7.5 or 7.0.

Yellow Rails (Coturnicops noveboracensis) are among the most secretive bird species in North America. They are poorly sampled by common survey protocols, and as a result their occurrence across much of their range is uncertain. We compiled occurrence records of the species and used resource selection functions to classify habitats as selected, neutral, or avoided using four different land cover maps in the oil sands region of northeastern Alberta. We assessed the accuracy of these maps using 279 previously unsurveyed locations and showed that a consensus-based ensemble classifier predicted occurrence more accurately than any single map. We combined the four maps into one map that rated habitat on a scale from 0 (consensus avoided) to 8 (consensus selected). Occupancy analysis showed increasing occupancy rates in areas with higher habitat suitability classes, with maximum occupancy rates of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.07-0.32) in class 8 habitat. We combined detections of 169 male Yellow Rails at surveyed locations with model predictions for unsurveyed locations to produce two population estimates for our study area, based on two estimates of the detection radius of the species. The estimate assuming a 150-m detection radius was 2747 males (95% CI: 588-5563), and the estimate assuming a 250-m detection radius was 1650 males (95% CI: 416-3266). Although estimates contained substantial uncertainty, our results suggest a larger number of Yellow Rails in the region than previously thought, which alters the current understanding of the distribution of this species. We estimated that about 17% of the population in our study area resides on oil sands leases that cover 14% of the study area, in habitats facing ongoing and future industrial development. The availability of a habitat map based on empirical evidence and detailed analyses for this species of conservation concern will improve targeted monitoring and promote mitigation of potential effects of development.
RÉSUMÉ
Le râle jaune (Coturnicops noveboracensis) est l'une des espèces d'oiseau les plus secrètes d'Amérique du Nord. Les protocoles d'enquête courants ne permettant pas de les échantillonner correctement, leur occurrence sur une grande partie de leur territoire demeure incertaine. Nous avons compilé les enregistrements d'occurrence de cette espèce et utilisé des fonctions de sélection des ressources pour classer les habitats comme suit : sélectionnés, neutres ou évités. Nous avons pour ce faire utilisé quatre cartes différentes de couverture du territoire dans la région des sables bitumineux du nord-est de l'Alberta. Nous avons évalué l'efficacité de ces cartes en utilisant 279 sites qui n'avaient encore jamais été étudiés et démontré qu'un classificateur global reposant sur un consensus permet de prévoir l'occurrence avec plus de précision que toute carte individuelle. Nous avons combiné les quatre cartes en une seule, qui classait les habitats sur une échelle de 0 (globalement évités) à 8 (globalement sélectionnés). L'analyse d'occupation a démontré des taux d'occupation croissants dans les zones présentant des classes supérieures d'adéquation à l'habitat de 0,18 (IC de 95 % : 0,07 - 0,32) dans l'habitat de classe 8. Nous avons combiné les détections de 169 râles jaunes mâles sur les sites observés avec les prévisions modélisées des sites non étudiés afin de produire deux estimations de population pour notre zone d'étude, reposant sur deux estimations du rayon de détection de l'espèce. L'estimation supposant un rayon de détection de 150 m était de 2 747 mâles (IC de 95 % : 588-5 563), et l'estimation supposant un rayon de détection de 250 m était de 1 650 mâles (IC de 95 % : 416-3 266). Bien que ces estimations présentent une incertitude substantielle, nos résultats suggèrent que les râles jaunes sont plus nombreux dans la région qu'on ne le croyait précédemment, ce qui modifie la compréhension actuelle de la répartition de cette espèce. Nous avons estimé qu'environ 17 % de la population dans notre zone d'étude réside dans des territoires riches en sables bitumineux qui couvrent 14 % de la zone d'étude. Ces habitats sont confrontés à un développement industriel actuel et futur. La disponibilité d'une carte d'habitat basée sur des preuves empiriques et des analyses détaillées de cette espèce dont la conservation est préoccupante améliorera la surveillance ciblée et favorisera l'atténuation des effets potentiels de ce développement.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art10/ACE-ECO-2020-1538.pdf,ace-eco.org,jaune,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.49447011591093,"['ou', 'coturnicops noveboracensis']",780

Here, we review experimental studies in corvids and parrots that tested complex cognitive processes within this tool kit. We then provide experimental examples for the potential involvement of metacognitive skills in the expression of the cognitive tool kit. We further expand the discussion of cognitive and metacognitive abilities in avian species, suggesting that an integrated assessment of these processes, together with revised and multiple tasks of mirror self-recognition, might shed light on one of the most highly debated topics in the literature—self-awareness in animals.

In general, sexes are considered monomorphic in size and colour, but several authors have reported females of some species within this family as being slightly paler than their conspecific counterparts. Our aim was to assess levels of sexual dichromatism in a set of ovenbird species representing a diversity of genera and plumage patterns; Furnarius rufus, Phleocryptes melanops, Synallaxis spixi and Schoeniophylax phryganophilus. For each species, we quantified sexual differences in brightness and colouration among 8–10 different plumage regions through modelling avian perceptual colour-space distances. To best inform our visual modelling parameters, we successfully sequenced the SWS1 gene fragment (associated with short-wavelength, including ultraviolet, visual sensitivity in birds) for one species, P. melanops, and found it possessed an amino acid sequence consistent with the VS-type SWS1 visual system. This provides further evidence supporting the presence of VS-sensitive opsin in ovenbirds. Among all four species, females were consistently brighter than males in at least one plumage patch, but chromatic colour differences between sexes were significant only for the throat patches of Schoeniophylax phryganophilus.

Avian iris colors exhibit striking interspecific and intraspecific variations that correspond to unique evolutionary and ecological histories. Here, we identified the genetic basis of pearl (white) iris color in domestic pigeons (Columba livia) to explore the largely unknown genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of avian iris coloration. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach in 92 pigeons, we mapped the pearl iris trait to a 9 kb region containing the facilitative glucose transporter gene SLC2A11B. A nonsense mutation (W49X) leading to a premature stop codon in SLC2A11B was identified as the causal variant. Transcriptome analysis suggested that SLC2A11B loss of function may downregulate the xanthophore-differentiation gene CSF1R and the key pteridine biosynthesis gene GCH1, thus resulting in the pearl iris phenotype. Coalescence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the mutation originated approximately 5,400 years ago, coinciding with the onset of pigeon domestication, while positive selection was likely associated with artificial breeding. Within Aves, potentially impaired SLC2A11B was found in six species from six distinct lineages, four of which associated with their signature brown or blue eyes and lack of pteridine. Analysis of vertebrate SLC2A11B orthologs revealed relaxed selection in the avian clade, consistent with the scenario that during and after avian divergence from the reptilian ancestor, the SLC2A11B-involved development of dermal chromatophores likely degenerated in the presence of feather coverage. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of avian iris color variations and the evolution of pigmentation in vertebrates.",https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009770&type=printable,journals.plos.org,guerney,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.53334491471231,['columba livia'],233

Cranes (family Gruidae) represent a small, old, monophyletic group with well-corroborated phylogenetic relationships on the species level, and at the same time they exhibit a complex and well-described behavioural repertoire. We therefore investigated the evolution of behavioural traits of cranes in a phylogenetic context using several phylogenetic approaches and two types of trait scoring. The cranes exhibit more than a hundred behavioural displays, almost one third of which may be phylogenetically informative. More than half of the analysed traits carry a significant phylogenetic signal. The ancestor of cranes already exhibited a quite complex behavioural repertoire, which remained unchanged in Balearicinae but altered greatly in Gruinae, specifically by the shedding of traits rather than their creation. Trait scoring has an influence on results within the Gruinae, primarily in genera Bugeranus and Anthropoides. Albeit the behavioural traits alone cannot be used for resolving species-level relationships within the Gruidae, when optimized on molecular tree, they can help us to detect interesting evolutionary transformations of behaviour repertoire within Gruiformes.

Effective management of wildlife populations requires identification of the factors limiting their growth. The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) is an imperiled, disturbance-dependent, shorebird species that nests on broad, sparsely vegetated beaches, sandbars, and lakeshores. In areas minimally affected by human use, plover habitat loss occurs through vegetation encroachment and erosion. Alternatively, habitat availability may be increased by sand deposition caused by storm- or flood-induced sediment transport or scouring that removes vegetation, or by receding lake levels. To test the hypothesis that plover populations are limited by available breeding habitat, we estimated the amount of habitat available before and after four significant storm and flooding events (i.e., disturbance) by classifying pre- and postdisturbance aerial imagery. We then evaluated the population changes that occurred after disturbance-related habitat alterations. Additionally, we report on population changes from four population increases that occurred after habitat creation events for which we did not have imagery suitable for classification. The storm and flood effects considered were those from hurricanes and nor’easters on barrier islands of Virginia, North Carolina, New York, and Maryland, USA, and those from floods and high water output from the Gavins Point Dam on the Missouri River between South Dakota and Nebraska, USA. The amount of nesting habitat increased 27–950% at these sites, and plover populations increased overall 72–622% after these events (increase of 8–217 pairs in 3 to 8 years after the disturbance, average 12–116% increase annually). The demographic changes were driven by productivity in some cases and probably by increases in immigration in others, and occurred simultaneously with regional increases. Our results support our hypothesis that the focal plover populations were at or near carrying capacity and are habitat limited. Currently, human interventions such as beach stabilization, the construction of artificial dunes, and dams reduce natural disturbance, and therefore, the carrying capacity, in many plover breeding areas. If these interventions were reduced or modified in such a way as to create and improve habitat, plover populations would likely reach higher average numbers and the potential for achieving recovery goals would be increased.
RÉSUMÉ
La gestion efficace des populations de faune sauvage requiert l'identification des facteurs qui limitent leur croissance. Le pluvier siffleur (Charadrius melodus) est une espèce d'oiseaux de rivage menacée, dépendante des perturbations, qui niche sur de grandes plages à la végétation clairsemée, sur les bancs de sable et au bord des lacs. Dans les régions peu affectées par la présence humaine, la perte d'habitat du pluvier est due à l'empiètement de la végétation et à l'érosion. La disponibilité de l'habitat peut aussi être accrue par les dépôts de sable causés par les transports de sédiments induits par les tempêtes ou les inondations, par l'affouillement qui élimine la végétation ou par la baisse du niveau des lacs. Pour tester l'hypothèse selon laquelle les populations de pluvier sont limitées par l'habitat de reproduction disponible, nous avons estimé la surface d'habitat disponible avant et après quatre événements majeurs de tempête et d'inondation (c'est-à-dire des perturbations) en classant les images aériennes avant et après les perturbations. Nous avons ensuite évalué l'évolution des populations survenue après les altérations de l'habitat liées aux perturbations. En outre, nous rapportons sur les changements de population par suite de quatre augmentations de la population intervenues après des événements de création d'habitat pour lesquels nous ne disposions pas d'imagerie adéquate pour établir un classement. Les effets des tempêtes et des inondations considérées étaient ceux d'ouragans et de tempêtes sur les îles barrières de Virginie, de Caroline du Nord, de New York et du Maryland, aux États-Unis, et ceux des inondations provoquées par le débit d'eau élevé du barrage de Gavins Point, sur le Missouri, entre le Dakota du Sud et le Nebraska, également aux États-Unis. La superficie de l'habitat de nidification a augmenté de 27 à 950 % sur ces sites et les populations de pluviers ont augmenté globalement de 72 à 622 % après ces événements (le nombre de couples est passé de 8 à 217 en 3 à 8 ans à la suite de ces perturbations, soit une augmentation moyenne annuelle de 12 à 116 %). Les évolutions démographiques résultaient de la productivité dans certains cas et probablement d'augmentations des migrations dans d'autres cas, et correspondaient à des augmentations régionales. Nos résultats viennent étayer notre hypothèse selon laquelle les populations de pluviers observées étaient à leur capacité porteuse et sont limitées par l'habitat. Actuellement, les interventions humaines comme la stabilisation des plages, la construction de dunes artificielles et de barrages réduisent les perturbations naturelles et en conséquence, la capacité porteuse, dans de nombreuses régions de reproduction des pluviers. Si ces interventions étaient réduites ou modifiées de manière à créer et à améliorer l'habitat, les populations de pluviers atteindraient probablement des nombres moyens plus élevés et le potentiel de réalisation des objectifs de rétablissement des populations serait plus élevé.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss1/art19/ACE-ECO-2019-1373.pdf,ace-eco.org,dunes,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.57423913700889,"['charadrius melodus', 'piping plover', 'ou']",1054

The demographic changes were driven by productivity in some cases and probably by increases in immigration in others, and occurred simultaneously with regional increases. Our results support our hypothesis that the focal plover populations were at or near carrying capacity and are habitat limited. Currently, human interventions such as beach stabilization, the construction of artificial dunes, and dams reduce natural disturbance, and therefore, the carrying capacity, in many plover breeding areas. If these interventions were reduced or modified in such a way as to create and improve habitat, plover populations would likely reach higher average numbers and the potential for achieving recovery goals would be increased.
RÉSUMÉ
La gestion efficace des populations de faune sauvage requiert l'identification des facteurs qui limitent leur croissance. Le pluvier siffleur (Charadrius melodus) est une espèce d'oiseaux de rivage menacée, dépendante des perturbations, qui niche sur de grandes plages à la végétation clairsemée, sur les bancs de sable et au bord des lacs. Dans les régions peu affectées par la présence humaine, la perte d'habitat du pluvier est due à l'empiètement de la végétation et à l'érosion. La disponibilité de l'habitat peut aussi être accrue par les dépôts de sable causés par les transports de sédiments induits par les tempêtes ou les inondations, par l'affouillement qui élimine la végétation ou par la baisse du niveau des lacs. Pour tester l'hypothèse selon laquelle les populations de pluvier sont limitées par l'habitat de reproduction disponible, nous avons estimé la surface d'habitat disponible avant et après quatre événements majeurs de tempête et d'inondation (c'est-à-dire des perturbations) en classant les images aériennes avant et après les perturbations. Nous avons ensuite évalué l'évolution des populations survenue après les altérations de l'habitat liées aux perturbations. En outre, nous rapportons sur les changements de population par suite de quatre augmentations de la population intervenues après des événements de création d'habitat pour lesquels nous ne disposions pas d'imagerie adéquate pour établir un classement. Les effets des tempêtes et des inondations considérées étaient ceux d'ouragans et de tempêtes sur les îles barrières de Virginie, de Caroline du Nord, de New York et du Maryland, aux États-Unis, et ceux des inondations provoquées par le débit d'eau élevé du barrage de Gavins Point, sur le Missouri, entre le Dakota du Sud et le Nebraska, également aux États-Unis. La superficie de l'habitat de nidification a augmenté de 27 à 950 % sur ces sites et les populations de pluviers ont augmenté globalement de 72 à 622 % après ces événements (le nombre de couples est passé de 8 à 217 en 3 à 8 ans à la suite de ces perturbations, soit une augmentation moyenne annuelle de 12 à 116 %). Les évolutions démographiques résultaient de la productivité dans certains cas et probablement d'augmentations des migrations dans d'autres cas, et correspondaient à des augmentations régionales. Nos résultats viennent étayer notre hypothèse selon laquelle les populations de pluviers observées étaient à leur capacité porteuse et sont limitées par l'habitat. Actuellement, les interventions humaines comme la stabilisation des plages, la construction de dunes artificielles et de barrages réduisent les perturbations naturelles et en conséquence, la capacité porteuse, dans de nombreuses régions de reproduction des pluviers. Si ces interventions étaient réduites ou modifiées de manière à créer et à améliorer l'habitat, les populations de pluviers atteindraient probablement des nombres moyens plus élevés et le potentiel de réalisation des objectifs de rétablissement des populations serait plus élevé.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss1/art19/ACE-ECO-2019-1373.pdf,ace-eco.org,crab-plover,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.57423913700889,"['charadrius melodus', 'piping plover', 'ou']",1054

In the 'thirties of last century, the idea of producing a ‘fauna’ worthy of British science, in which every species of animal known to occur in Britain should be described and figured, with some account of its habits, habitat and synonymy, by the united labours of several naturalists, each an expert in his own line, was being realised under the sympathetic management of Mr. Van Voorst. Yet in spite of the loving care that he lavished on the production, as is abundantly shown by the charming vignettes which adorn each chapter of his books, it became apparent to the naturalists who in 1843 attended the meeting of the British Association in Cork, that Van Voorst's series had begun with monographs which were ‘best sellers’, such as Bell's “British Quadrupeds”1839, Yarrell's “British Fishes”1836 and “Birds”1843, and that there would remain a considerable residue of un-monographed classes of animals for which neither the British Association, nor the scientific societies, nor publishers would have the funds necessary for publication. “To rescue such precious materials from oblivion, is one of the objects for which the Bay Society was instituted.”",,nature.com,yarrell,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.58448270077282,,1000

Nakhon Sawan Province is located in Upper Central Thailand, where the Chao Phraya River, the vital river of Thailand, begins. According to the distribution of the archaeological sites, the related geological features were divided into two groups by geodiversity scope: (1) hydrological sites - Chao Phraya river, Bueng Boraphet lake, (2) speleological sites - Tham Phet-Tham Thong cave and Khoa Nor mountain. The hydrological sites are the primary water resources of local people since many hundred years, including transportation, agriculture, and fishery, so there are many archaeological sites around there. In addition, the speleological sites are covered with limestones intruded by the granitic rocks, which has caused ore deposition in the form of skarn. The evidence of antiquities in the archaeological site near speleological sites suggests that ancient people discovered and produced their ores, notably iron in the studied area. Based on inventory, characterization, classification, and assessment methods, this preliminary geoarchaeology study can support Nakhon Sawan to promote geotourism for sustainability by their stunning geological features, fantastic nature as well as beautiful culture, both past and present.",https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/quageo-2020-0023,sciendo.com,river-martin,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.58644492322546,,623

Birds that meet this demand through nectarivory face the added challenges of maintaining homeostasis in the face of spikes in blood sugar associated with nectar meals, as well as transporting that sugar to energetically demanding tissues. Nectarivory has evolved many times in birds and we hypothesized that the challenges of this dietary strategy would exert selective pressure on key aspects of metabolic physiology. Specifically, we hypothesized we would find convergent or parallel amino acid substitutions among different nectarivorous lineages in a protein important to sensing, regulating, and transporting glucose, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). Genetic sequences for GLUT2 were obtained from ten pairs of nectarivorous and non-nectarivorous sister taxa. We performed PCR amplification of the intracellular C-terminal domain of GLUT2 and adjacent protein domains due to the role of this region in determination of transport rate, substrate specificity and glucosensing. Our findings have ruled out the C-terminal regulatory region of GLUT2 as a target for selection by sugar-rich diet among avian nectarivores, though selection among hummingbirds, the oldest avian nectarivores, cannot be discounted. Our results indicate future studies should examine down-stream targets of GLUT2-mediated glucosensing and insulin secretion, such as insulin receptors and their targets, as potential sites of selection by nectarivory in birds.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-020-00231-8,avianres.biomedcentral.com,roberts,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.58756889350002,,530

Unrelated species sharing genetic underpinnings for phenotypic convergence suggests strong genetic constraints, and thus high predictability of evolution. However, there is no clear big picture of the genomic constraints on convergent evolution. Genome-based phylogenies have confirmed many cases of phenotypic convergence in birds, making them a good system for examining genetic constraints in phenotypic convergence. In this study, we used hierarchical genomic approaches to estimate genetic constraints in three convergent avian traits: nocturnality, raptorial behavior and foot-propelled diving. Results Phylogeny-based hypothesis tests and positive selection tests were applied to compare 16 avian genomes, representing 14 orders, and identify genes with strong convergence signals. We found 43 adaptively convergent genes (ACGs) associated with the three phenotypic convergence cases and assessed genetic constraints in all three cases, from (amino acid) site mutations to genetic pathways. We found that the avian orders shared few site mutations in the ACGs that contributed to the convergent phenotypes, and that these ACGs were not enriched in any genetic pathways. In addition, different pairs of orders with convergent foot-propelled diving or raptorial behaviors shared few ACGs. We also found that closely related orders that shared foot-propelled diving behavior did not share more ACGs than did distinct orders, suggesting that convergence among these orders could not be explained by their initial genomic backgrounds. Conclusions Our analyses of three avian convergence events suggest low constraints for phenotypic convergence across multiple genetic levels, implying that genetic evolution is unpredictable at the phylogenetic level of avian order. Ours is one of first studies to apply hierarchical genomic examination to multiple avian convergent cases to assess the genetic constraints in life history trait evolution.",https://link.springer.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12862-020-01711-7,link.springer.com,chuck-will's-widow,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.60543211113359,,529

The need for retaining a functional copy of the CYP8B1 gene is established by the presence of a conserved open reading frame across most species screened in this study. Interestingly, the dietary switch from bovid to cetacean species is accompanied by an exceptional ten amino acid extension at the C-terminal end through a single base frame-shift deletion. We also verify that the coding frame disrupting mutations previously reported in the elephant are correct, are shared by extinct Elephantimorpha species and coincide with the dietary switch to herbivory. Relaxation of selection in the CYP8B1 gene of the wombat (Vombatus ursinus) also corresponds to drastic change in diet.

Among birds, self-care tooling is seemingly rare in the wild, despite several anecdotal reports of this behaviour in captive parrots. Here, we show that Bruce, a disabled parrot lacking his top mandible, deliberately uses pebbles to preen himself. Evidence for this behaviour comes from five lines of evidence: (i) in over 90% of instances where Bruce picked up a pebble, he then used it to preen; (ii) in 95% of instances where Bruce dropped a pebble, he retrieved this pebble, or replaced it, in order to resume preening; (iii) Bruce selected pebbles of a specific size for preening rather than randomly sampling available pebbles in his environment; (iv) no other kea in his environment used pebbles for preening; and (v) when other individuals did interact with stones, they used stones of different sizes to those Bruce preened with. Our study provides novel and empirical evidence for deliberate self-care tooling in a bird species where tooling is not a species-specific behaviour.

It has long been concluded from chemical analyses, and more recently from genetic studies, that uric acid is the principal constituent of urine in Aves. However, research has also demonstrated that waste material may be modified in the ceca immediately prior to it being expelled. Here, we quantify the chemical composition of the urine component of excreta of six avian species using X-ray diffraction techniques to test the hypothesis that it is principally composed of uric acid, as commonly reported. None of the analyzed samples were found to contain uric acid. Instead, a variety of compounds including ammonium urate, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and two unknown compounds, were found. Our results show that the uric acid pathway is indeed the system by which nitrogen is removed in these birds, but that additional modification occurs in the urine prior to excretion.

The populations of many species of raptors that forage in agroecosystems have declined as agriculture has intensified. Cover crops are a recent trend in areas of intensive row-crop agriculture in the Midwestern United States that could positively affect raptors by increasing the abundance and distribution of raptor prey. We assessed the habitat use of two raptors, American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) and Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and tested for use of areas near cover-cropped fields. We conducted 1184 km of roadside transects in 2018 and 2019 in west-central Indiana and recorded 191 detections of our focal species. We constructed resource selection functions within a use-availability design to evaluate raptor habitat use with a series of weighted logistic regression models. For each species, we fitted models at two scales (transect and landscape) and with two definitions of available points (completely random and random subject to perch constraints). American Kestrels were strongly associated with cover-cropped agricultural fields. Red-tailed Hawks were strongly associated with woodlots. Scale did not greatly affect the inclusion of habitat variables into top models for either species. Random models identified potential perch sites, whereas constrained random models identified more subtle habitat preferences not included in the random models. For American Kestrels, constrained models revealed reduced use of woodland perches and increased use of perches near cover-cropped and conventional agricultural fields. For Red-tailed Hawks, constrained models revealed habitat associations, particularly reduced use of utility lines and human development, that were absent or de-emphasized in random models. Modeling resource selection with constrained random availability will work best for well-studied species with discrete, easily mapped habitat features. If damage to commodity crops by rodents in cover-cropped fields is a concern, raptor management should focus on kestrels and could include erection of artificial perches, nest boxes, and enhancement of permanent herbaceous habitats for hunting.
RÉSUMÉ
Les populations de nombreuses espèces de rapaces qui se nourrissent dans les agroécosystèmes ont diminué avec l'intensification de l'agriculture. Les cultures de couverture, une tendance récente dans les zones de cultures intensives en rangs du Midwest des États-Unis, pourraient avoir un effet positif sur les rapaces en permettant d'augmenter l'abondance et la répartition de leurs proies. Nous avons évalué l'utilisation d'habitat de deux rapaces, la Crécerelle d'Amérique (Falco sparverius) et la Buse à queue rousse (Buteo jamaicensis), et testé l'utilisation des zones près des champs de cultures de couverture. Nous avons inventorié 1 184 km de transects en bord de routes en 2018 et 2019 dans le centre-ouest de l'Indiana et noté 191 détections de nos espèces cibles. Nous avons construit des fonctions de sélection des ressources dans le cadre d'un plan utilisation-disponibilité pour évaluer l'utilisation d'habitat par les rapaces à l'aide d'une série de modèles de régression logistique pondérée. Pour chaque espèce, nous avons ajusté les modèles à deux échelles (transect et paysage) et selon deux définitions de disponibilité (complètement aléatoire ou aléatoire avec contraintes de perchoir). Les crécerelles ont été fortement associées aux champs de cultures de couverture. Les buses étaient fortement associées aux boisés. L'échelle n'a pas eu un grand effet sur l'inclusion des variables d'habitat dans les meilleurs modèles pour les deux espèces. Les modèles aléatoires ont identifié des sites potentiels pour se percher, tandis que les modèles aléatoires avec contraintes ont identifié des préférences d'habitat plus subtiles et non incluses dans les modèles aléatoires. Pour les crécerelles, les modèles avec contraintes ont révélé une utilisation réduite des perchoirs en forêt et une utilisation accrue des perchoirs à proximité des champs de cultures de couverture et de cultures conventionnelles. Pour les buses, les modèles avec contraintes ont révélé des associations avec l'habitat, en particulier une faible utilisation des lignes de services publics et des aménagements humains, qui étaient absentes ou atténuées dans les modèles aléatoires.

Abstract
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic, vector-borne infectious disease of ruminants and camels transmitted mainly by the Aedes and Culex mosquito species. Contact with the blood or organs of infected animals may infect humans. Its etiological factor is the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the Phlebovirus genus and Bunyaviridae family. Sheep and goats are most susceptible to infection and newborns and young individuals endure the most severe disease course. High abortion rates and infant mortality are typical for RVF; its clinical signs are high fever, lymphadenitis, nasal and ocular secretions and vomiting. Conventional diagnosis is done by the detection of specific IgM or IgG antibodies and RVFV nucleic acids and by virus isolation. Inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines obtained from virulent RVFV isolates are available for livestock. RVF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but in the last two decades, it was also reported in other African regions. Seropositive animals were detected in Turkey, Tunisia and Libya. The wide distribution of competent vectors in non-endemic areas coupled with global climate change threaten to spread RVF transboundarily. The EFSA considers the movement of infected animals and vectors to be other plausible pathways of RVF introduction into Europe.",https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2021-0009,sciendo.com,mayotte,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.72862437272836,['turkey'],450

The effective conservation of birds requires knowledge of species-specific population dynamics. Yet these dynamics during migration and across age and sex categories are poorly understood for small birds. The goal of this study was to assess large-scale fall migration patterns of Rufous Hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus). Because the age and sex categories of this species depart from the breeding grounds and arrive from migration on different weeks, we predicted that each might use different migration routes, differ in migration speeds, and vary in their weekly distributions. Rufous Hummingbirds are among a few declining species for which a large amount of banding data is available during migration and across the migration corridor. We assembled a large hummingbird capture dataset (28,948 captures; 459 unique locations; fall migrations from 1998 to 2013) and used the centroid location of each age-sex-year-week group to calculate migration routes, timing, and speed. We used a utilization distribution kernel to measure distributions during migration. Adult females tended to have a southbound migration route parallel and between those of young and adult males. Moreover, a greater number of young birds migrated south through California in comparison to adult females and adult males. Our results suggest that the migration of each age-sex category is separated by approximately two weeks with adult males migrating first, followed by adult females, and then the young of both sexes; yet migration speed was not statistically different among categories. Last, adult males were captured within a smaller geographic distribution, i.e., the area during any given week of migration, compared with adult females and young. We conclude that different age-sex categories of Rufous Hummingbirds use alternative routes and differ in migration phenology and distributions. Our results suggest that the age-sex categories could be affected differentially by habitat loss, phenological changes, and climates during migration. Considering such demographic migratory dynamics could improve conservation outcomes.
RÉSUMÉ
La conservation efficace des oiseaux repose sur la connaissance des dynamiques de population propres aux espèces. Toutefois, ces dynamiques au moment de la migration et pour les différentes cohortes d'âges et de sexes sont mal connues chez les petits oiseaux. L'objectif de la présente étude était d'évaluer les tendances de migration automnale à grande échelle chez le Colibri roux (Selasphorus rufus). Parce que les cohortes d'âges et de sexes de cette espèce quittent les sites de nidification, migrent et arrivent sur leur lieu d'hivernage à des semaines différentes, nous avons prédit que chacune de ces cohortes utiliseraient des routes migratoires différentes, auraient des vitesses de migration différentes et varieraient dans leur répartition hebdomadaire. Le Colibri roux est parmi les quelques espèces en diminution pour lesquelles il existe une grande quantité de données de baguage durant la migration, et celles-ci sont réparties le long du corridor de migration. Nous avons assemblé un imposant jeu de données de captures de colibris (28 948 captures, 459 positions uniques, migrations automnales de 1998 à 2013) et avons utilisé le centre de la position de chaque groupe âge-sexe-année-semaine afin de calculer les corridors, le moment et la vitesse de migration. Les femelles adultes ont eu tendance à utiliser un corridor de migration vers le sud parallèle et entre ceux empruntés par les jeunes et les mâles adultes. De plus, davantage de jeunes ont migré vers le sud par la Californie comparativement aux femelles et aux mâles adultes. Nos résultats indiquent que la migration de chaque cohorte âge-sexe est séparée de deux semaines environ, les mâles adultes arrivant en premier, suivis des femelles adultes, puis des jeunes des deux sexes; cependant, les vitesses de migration n'était pas statistiquement différentes. Enfin, les mâles adultes ont été capturés à l'intérieur d'une répartition géographique plus restreinte, c.-à-d. l'aire durant n'importe quelle semaine de migration, comparativement aux femelles adultes et aux jeunes. Nous concluons que les différentes cohortes âge-sexe de Colibris roux utilisent des routes distinctes et se distinguent sur le plan migratoire, tant en matière de phénologie que de répartition.

The extremely polymorphic adaptive immune system of passerines, identified through their major histocompatibility complex class I genes (MHC-I), may explain some of this extreme radiation. Recent work has shown that passerines have higher numbers of MHC-I gene copies than other birds, but little is currently known about expression and function of these gene copies. Non-passerine birds have a single highly expressed MHC-I gene copy, a pattern that seems unlikely in passerines. We used high-throughput sequencing to study MHC-I alleles in siskins (Spinus spinus) and determined gene expression, phylogenetic relationships and sequence divergence. We verified between six and 16 MHC-I alleles per individual and 97% of these were expressed. Strikingly, up to five alleles per individual had high expression. Out of 88 alleles 18 were putatively non-classical with low sequence divergence and expression, and found in a single phylogenetic cluster. The remaining 70 alleles were classical, with high sequence divergence and variable degrees of expression. Our results contradict the suggestion that birds only have a single dominantly expressed MHC-I gene by demonstrating several highly expressed MHC-I gene copies in a passerine.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55800-9.pdf,nature.com,rosefinch,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.75074195358953,['spinus spinus'],852

With expanding anthropogenic disturbances to forests around the world, forest restoration is increasingly important for bird conservation. Restoration monitoring is critical for understanding how birds respond to forest regeneration and for assessing the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Using bioacoustic monitoring, we recorded bird communities during both dry and wet seasons at 62 sites along a chronosequence of tropical dry forests in the Área de Conservación Guanacaste in Costa Rica. Tropical dry forests rank among the globe’s most imperiled ecosystems, adding special urgency to their restoration and accompanying restoration monitoring. We found that bird species diversity, richness, and abundance increase with measures of forest maturity. Our results show that bird communities in regenerating areas become more similar to those of undisturbed areas as forests mature. This suggests that bird communities are recovering to predisturbed conditions in regenerating sites, and that maturing tropical dry forests are home to an increasingly diverse and abundant community of birds. We conducted an additional assessment, by sampling 30 locations using point-counts that were originally surveyed 23 years ago. We found that species richness and abundance were similar across this 23-year interval, although bird community composition changed because several forest-specialist species were only detected in the later period. Our research reveals that the regenerating tropical dry forests of northwestern Costa Rica have recovered species richness and abundance levels and are currently undergoing a succession in community composition toward that of a primary tropical dry forest. Our study shows bird communities recovering in a nearly century-old chronosequence of regenerating forests.

The phylogeny of the Hylobatidae remains unclear. India is reported to have one species of Hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock) but a recent study based on pelage colour suggested that another species, H. leuconedys, occurs in the Mishmi Hills between the Dibang and Nao Dehing rivers in Arunachal Pradesh. We examined whether H. leuconedys occurs in India and its evolutionary relationships with other Hylobatidae species. We collected blood, tissue, and fecal samples from various populations of H. hoolock (N = 17) and the Mishmi Hills gibbons (N = 14) from their distribution in Northeast India, zoos, and rescues centers. We isolated DNA from these samples and constructed phylogenetic trees using partial D-loop and COI markers. We also performed whole mitochondrial analysis to study the phylogenetics of the Hylobatidae family. Our genetic analysis showed that none of the samples from India were H. leuconedys, and that all samples from the Mishmi Hills could be assigned to H. hoolock. Our mitogenome analysis supported this conclusion. We estimate that gibbon divergence from a common ancestor occurred 8.38 mya and that the split between H. hoolock and H. leuconedys occurred 1.49 mya. These findings will facilitate exchange of individuals from different zoos for captive breeding programs and conservation and management of wild populations of these gibbons.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10764-021-00212-8.pdf,link.springer.com,matsudaira,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.75968400199327,,377

The ability to exchange vocalizations in an alternating fashion is also exhibited by other species, including zebra finches. With a combination of behavioral testing, electrophysiological recordings, and pharmacological manipulations we demonstrate that activity within a cortical premotor nucleus orchestrates the timing of calls in socially interacting zebra finches. Within this circuit, local inhibition precedes premotor neuron activation associated with calling. Blocking inhibition results in faster vocal responses as well as an impaired ability to flexibly avoid overlapping with a partner. These results support a working model in which premotor inhibition regulates context-dependent timing of vocalizations and enables the precise interleaving of vocal signals during turn-taking. Control over when to initiate or withhold vocalizations is essential for vocal turn-taking. Here the authors investigate vocal interactions in zebra finches and show that inhibition within the premotor nucleus HVC plays an important role in the precise timing of vocal motor responses.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13938-0.pdf,nature.com,graybird,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.76393615610696,,831

In the absence of science, myths and legends typically prevailed, and in the case of seaweed science today, many kernels of truth have now been exposed. This review traces myths and legends and some poetry which has been influenced by macroalgae over the ages, and it describes some of the early uses of seaweeds by humankind across the globe. With such a prominent role in the minds and imaginations of story tellers, artists, musicians, and poets, seaweeds command a position of respect in the evolution of ecological goods and services. While not strictly scientific, the information reviewed and laid out in this article underpins some of those uses of seaweeds that have now been established following thorough evidence-based research. Such research leads to a myriad of values of the goods and services rendered by seaweeds and their extracts, providing significant benefits to mankind, both currently, and into the future.

In vertebrates, adaptation to hypoxic high-altitude environments involves the coordination of multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms, including selection on the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and the blood-O2 transport protein hemoglobin (Hb). In two Andean duck species, a striking DNA sequence similarity reflecting identity by descent is present across the ~20 kb β-globin cluster including both embryonic (HBE) and adult (HBB) paralogs, though it was yet untested whether this is due to independent parallel evolution or adaptive introgression. In this study, we find that identical amino acid substitutions in the β-globin cluster that increase Hb-O2 affinity have likely resulted from historical interbreeding between high-altitude populations of two different distantly-related species. We examined the direction of introgression and discovered that the species with a deeper mtDNA divergence that colonized high altitude earlier in history (Anas flavirostris) transferred adaptive genetic variation to the species with a shallower divergence (A. georgica) that likely colonized high altitude more recently possibly following a range shift into a novel environment. As a consequence, the species that received these β-globin variants through hybridization might have adapted to hypoxic conditions in the high-altitude environment more quickly through acquiring beneficial alleles from the standing, hybrid-origin variation, leading to faster evolution.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-021-00437-6.pdf,nature.com,hey,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.79927211029802,"['andean duck', 'anas flavirostris']",359

Micronesian Starlings (Aplonis opaca) are one of two native forest bird species that have survived on the island of Guam despite predation by invasive brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis). We report the first detailed account of the starling’s breeding biology to help understand how this species has persisted and guide management to conserve and expand the population. Our surveys indicated that although starlings continued to forage in nearby forest, nesting occurred almost exclusively in developed habitat on Andersen Air Force Base. We located 36 active nest sites in a variety of natural and artificial structures, many of which were likely difficult or impossible for snakes to access. We report reproductive data from those nest sites and also predator-resistant nestboxes (n= 48 pairs using 58 boxes) installed in our study area. Typical of tropical species, the average clutch was small (2.19 ± 0.55 [SD] over 431 nesting attempts), but pairs nested repeatedly throughout the year. Pairs showed high site fidelity, and nestboxes (n= 70) installed at least 34 m from forest edge were readily colonized with 77% occupied by the end of our study. Protected nestboxes in urbanized areas along with snake suppression may be useful strategies for expanding the population of Micronesian Starlings and consequently restoring seed dispersal in nearby forest on Guam.
RÉSUMÉ
Les Stournes de Micronésie (Aplonis opaca) sont l'une des deux espèces d'oiseaux forestiers indigènes qui ont survécu sur l'île de Guam, malgré la prédation qu'ils subissent par les serpents bruns arboricoles envahissants (Boiga irregularis). Nous présentons le premier compte-rendu détaillé de la biologie de reproduction du stourne, visant à comprendre comment cette espèce a subsisté et à guider la gestion pour conserver et étendre sa population. Nos relevés ont montré que, bien que les stournes continuent de s'alimenter dans les forêts avoisinantes, leur nidification a lieu presque exclusivement dans les milieux aménagés sur la base aérienne d'Andersen. Nous avons localisé 36 sites de nidification actifs dans une variété de structures naturelles et artificielles, dont beaucoup étaient probablement difficiles ou impossibles d'accès par les serpents. Nous rapportons les paramètres de reproduction à ces sites de nidification ainsi qu'à des nichoirs à l'épreuve des prédateurs (n = 48 couples utilisant 58 nichoirs) installés dans notre aire d'étude. Typique des espèces tropicales, la taille moyenne de la ponte était petite (2,19 ± 0,55 [écart-type] sur 431 essais de nidification), mais les couples ont niché à plusieurs reprises tout au long de l'année. Les couples ont montré une grande fidélité à leur site, et les nichoirs (n = 70) installés à au moins 34 m de la lisière forestière ont été colonisés, avec 77 % d'occupation à la fin de notre étude.

Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) genes play a role in parasite detection as part of the innate immune system whereas Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes encode proteins that display antigens as part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Thus, both gene families are under selection pressure from pathogens. The bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) is a passerine bird that is a common host of avian malarial parasites (Plasmodium sp. and Haemoproteus sp.). We assessed molecular variation of TLR and MHC genes in a wild population of bananaquits and identified allelic associations with resistance/susceptibility to parasitic infection to address hypotheses of avian immune response to haemosporidian parasites. Results We found that allele frequencies are associated with infection status at the immune loci studied. A consistent general trend showed the infected groups possessed more alleles at lower frequencies, and exhibited unique alleles, compared to the uninfected group. Conclusions Our results support the theory of natural selection favoring particular alleles for resistance while maintaining overall genetic diversity in the population, a mechanism which has been demonstrated in some systems in MHC previously but understudied in TLRs.",https://link.springer.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12862-019-1435-y,link.springer.com,bananaquit,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.85393179996511,"['coereba flaveola', 'bananaquit']",1064

Eddy kinetic energy (EKE), derived from time-dependent circulation, is commonly used to study mesoscale eddies. However, there are three deficiencies of EKE when focusing on the analysis of coherent mesoscale eddies. Here, we propose a comprehensive concept—Lagrangian EKE (LEKE) as an additional metric which is a combination of gridded EKE calculated in Eulerian framework and tracked coherent mesoscale eddies in Lagrangian framework. Evidences suggest that LEKE can make up these deficiencies as an effective supplement. In this study, regional application over Northwestern Pacific Ocean is taken as an example. It clearly demonstrates that LEKE reveals more accurate and detailed characteristics of both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies than EKE when coherent mesoscale eddies are the specific focus, such as the variation rates of kinetic energy during the eddy propagation, spatial–temporal differences of kinetic energy between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Overall, using LEKE to analyze coherent mesoscale eddies gives the rise to understand the spatial–temporal contrasts between eddies with different polarities, and provides a new perspective to recognize the crucial role played by coherent mesoscale eddies in the ocean.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69503-z.pdf,nature.com,ke'eke'e,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.8544168873286,,658

Here, we compare the changes in anatomical organization and modularity of the skull of extinct and extant archosaurs using an Anatomical Network Analysis approach. We show that the number of bones, their topological arrangement, and modular organization can discriminate birds from non-avian dinosaurs, and crurotarsans. We could also discriminate extant taxa from extinct species when adult birds were included. By comparing within the same framework, juveniles and adults for crown birds and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), we find that adult and juvenile alligator skulls are topologically similar, whereas juvenile bird skulls have a morphological complexity and anisomerism more similar to those of non-avian dinosaurs and crurotarsans than of their own adult forms.

Home-range area was estimated to be 4517 km², possibly an underestimation due to reduced sample size. The average traveled distance per night was 55 km (range: 0-112 km). Analyses of habitat use showed a clear preference for areas with higher forest cover. Height above sea level was also largely associated with frequencies of habitat use, indicating a low use of areas above 3000 m, while the degree of fragmentation was not a strong predictor of habitat use.

Bachman’s Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) is a species of conservation concern throughout its range and an effective indicator of healthy pine savanna ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Their secretive nesting behavior means that many aspects of their nesting ecology, including specific knowledge of the nest predator community and nest defense behaviors are insufficiently described. This information is an important first step in determining the link between management practices and reproductive success. We monitored 86 Bachman’s Sparrow nests, 65 with constant video surveillance, to describe the nest predator community, cause-specific nest mortality rate, and nest defense behavior. We identified 12 predator species from 37 predation events. Snakes were the dominant predator type, responsible for 51% of identified predation events, followed by mesomammals (19%), small mammals (16%), and others (14%). Nest defense behavior included ptiloerection and chasing but was rare (16% of predation events) and effective 67% of the time. Daily nest survival was 0.936 (CI: 0.894 – 0.967) and neither season, year, nor site explained a significant amount of variation in estimates of cause-specific daily nest mortality. Raccoons were not detected at Bachman’s Sparrow nests despite being one of the most common nest predators in other avian nest surveillance studies. Future studies should explore the link between prescribed fire, nest predation, and snake abundance or activity in southeastern pine savanna.
RÉSUMÉ
Le Bruant des pinèdes (Peucaea aestivalis) est une espèce préoccupante dans l'ensemble de son aire et est un bon indicateur d'écosystèmes de pinèdes sains dans le sud-est des États-Unis. Leur comportement discret au nid explique que de nombreux aspects de leur écologie de nidification soient encore mal décrits. Cette connaissance est une première étape importante si l'on veut établir les liens entre les pratiques de gestion et le succès de reproduction. Nous avons surveillé 86 nids de Bruant des pinèdes, dont 65 sous vidéo continue, afin de décrire la communauté de prédateurs de nids, le taux de mortalité au nid spécifique aux causes et les comportements de défense au nid. Nous avons identifié 12 espèces de prédateurs à partir de 37 cas de prédation. Les serpents étaient les principaux prédateurs, responsables de 51 % des cas de prédation identifiés, suivis des mésomammifères (19 %), des petits mammifères (16 %) et d'autres prédateurs (14 %). Les comportements de défense au nid comprenaient la ptiloérection et la poursuite, mais ils survenaient rarement (16 % des cas de prédation) et étaient efficaces 67 % du temps. La survie quotidienne au nid était de 0,936 (CI: 0,894 - 0,967), et ni la saison, l'année ou le site n'ont expliqué l'importante variation des estimations de mortalité quotidienne au nid spécifique aux causes. Les ratons laveurs n'ont pas été détectés aux nids de bruants, bien qu'ils se soient avéré un des prédateurs les plus communs dans d'autres études de surveillance de nids.

Phylogenetic data also constructed an Atoxoplasma/Isospora clade with high sequence identities. High dose of the challenge with the parasite led to severe depression and sudden death, but it did not coincide with remarkable lesions and parasitic invasion in visceral organs.

Most songbird species show some degree of fidelity to their previous breeding location, especially after successful reproduction. However, species associated with highly dynamic food sources (e.g., outbreaking insects) may have to adopt more flexible strategies. Three species (Tennessee Warbler,Leiothlypis peregrina; Cape May Warbler,Setophaga tigrina; and Bay-breasted Warbler,S. castanea) show strong numerical responses to spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana- SBW) outbreaks. These species, referred to as ""budworm-linked warblers"", might track SBW larvae through extensive natal dispersal. Then, the superabundance of food during outbreaks would be expected to lead to high breeding productivity which, in turn, should promote breeding site fidelity. Here, we aimed to determine whether budworm-linked warblers were faithful to their previous year's breeding season location and, if so, whether their probability of return was influenced by habitat characteristics such as the density of SBW larvae, stand structure, or landscape structure. We hypothesized that return rate of budworm-linked warblers will be high, as reported in other species of New World warblers, and we predicted that among habitat characteristics, return rate will increase with the density of SBW larvae. We banded 117 budworm-linked warblers (94 % being males) in 75 study plots distributed along a gradient of SBW density and searched for returning individuals within 50 m of their capture sites using song playbacks. Contrary to our hypothesis, resighting rate was very low (0-10.5%). This relative ""infidelity"" suggests that breeding dispersal of budworm-linked warblers was relatively extensive. Only habitat proportion within an 8-km radius had an important (negative) effect on the probability of resighting Bay-breasted Warbler. Budworm-linked warblers did not exhibit strong site fidelity as adults, but instead performed breeding dispersal movements, presumably to track SBW outbreaks. This strategy may reflect strong spatiotemporal variations in the density SBW larvae.
RÉSUMÉ
La plupart des espèces de passereaux montrent une fidélité relative à leur site de reproduction, surtout lorsque celle-ci a été fructueuse. Cependant, les espèces associées à des ressources hautement dynamiques dans le temps et dans l'espace (p. ex. les insectes connaissant des phases épidémiques) sont susceptibles d'adopter des stratégies plus flexibles. Trois espèces (Paruline obscure, Leiothlypis peregrina ; Paruline tigrée, Setophaga tigrina ; Paruline à poitrine baie, S. castanea ) montrent une forte réponse numérique aux infestations de tordeuse des bourgeons de l'épinette (Choristoneura fumiferana - TBE). Ces espèces, que l'on appelle ""parulines de tordeuse"", pourraient en principe suivre les infestations de TBE via leur dispersion natale. Par la suite, la superabondance de nourriture durant les infestations devrait résulter en une productivité élevée, ce qui devrait promouvoir la fidélité au site de nidification. Dans le cadre de cette étude, nous voulions déterminer si les parulines de tordeuse étaient fidèles au site occupé durant la saison de reproduction précédente et, dans un tel cas, si leur probabilité de retour était influencée par les caractéristiques d'habitat, telles que la densité de larves de TBE, la structure des peuplements ou celle du paysage. Nous avons émis l'hypothèse selon laquelle le taux de retour des parulines de tordeuse serait élevé, tel qu'observé chez les autres espèces de parulines du Nouveau-Monde. De plus, nous avons prédit que parmi les caractéristiques d'habitat considérées, le taux de retour augmenterait avec la densité des larves de TBE. Nous avons bagué 117 parulines de tordeuse (incluant 94 % de mâles) dans 75 sites d'étude distribués le long d'un gradient de densité de TBE et nous avons cherché des individus de retour dans un rayon de 50 m de leur site de capture à l'aide de repasses de vocalisations. Contrairement à notre hypothèse, le taux de détection d'individus de retour a été très faible (0-10.5%). Cette ""infidelité"" relative suggère que, chez les parulines de tordeuse, la dispersion des adultes se fait sur des distances relativement grandes. Seule la proportion d'habitat dans un rayon de 8 km a eu un effet (négatif) important sur la probabilité de détection d'individus de retour, et seulement chez la Paruline à poitrine baie. Les parulines de tordeuse adultes n'ont pas montré une fidélité au site occupé l'année précédente, suggérant qu'elles ont effectué des mouvements de dispersion, possiblement afin de suivre la progression de l'infestation de TBE. Cette stratégie reflète sans doute les importantes variations spatiotemporelles observées dans la densité des larves de TBE.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art17/ACE-ECO-2021-1847.pdf,ace-eco.org,ortolan,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-9.9343390561507,"['leiothlypis peregrina', 'cape may warbler', 'tennessee warbler', 'ou', 'setophaga tigrina']",354

We tested snow bunting tissues (blood and liver) for the 4 pesticides most commonly used in grain agriculture in Canada: atrazine, chlothianidin, imidacloprid, and glyphosate, as well as a glyphosate derivative (aminomethylphosphic acid, AMPA). Although this species is thought to forage in grain fields during autumn through spring, we found no detectable traces of any of the five substances. Wintering buntings may either not be exposed to these pesticides during their presence in agriculture fields or, given the rapid turnover of these pesticides in the blood and tissues, be exposed to doses below detection level in samples.

The disease is caused by an obligate, intracellular protozoon known as Eimeria. Several Eimeria species known to infect chickens have been well documented. However, recent studies have elucidated the emergence of three novel genetic variants or operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The discovery of OTUx, OTUy and OTUz complicates the identification and diagnosis of coccidiosis. OTUs are clusters of unknown or uncultivated organisms that are grouped according to a similarity in DNA sequence to a set of specific gene markers. OTUs have been reported in the Earth's Southern Hemisphere, including Australia, Venezuela, India, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, China and Ghana.

Predation is often the leading cause of nest failure among passerines; however, specific causes are often unknown or can be misidentified in the field. Therefore, it is critical to improve our understanding of causes of nest predation and factors that influence passerine nest success. In the remnant bottomland hardwood forests of east-central Arkansas, we monitored 282 passerine nests during summers 2010-2012, including 81 nests at which we deployed video cameras. We calculated daily survival rates (DSRs) across species, locations, and years and determined which temporal, biological, and habitat variables correlated with nest success. We also estimated predation rates by specific predator groups. Our largest sample-sized species, Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea, n = 143 nests) and Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis, n = 97 nests), had similar mean DSRs (0.932 ± 0.01, 0.924 ± 0.01, respectively). Predation by all species and parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) together were the most frequent causes of nest failures (29% and 33%, respectively), although black rat snake (Pantherophis obsoletus) was the most frequent predator (37% of known predation events). Nest stage and number of vine tents best explained variation in DSRs; however, predictors of predation rates varied across predator groups. For example, vegetation density negatively influenced the probability of nest predation by snakes and mammals, but positively influenced the probability of nest predation by cowbirds and did not influence the probability of nest predation by other avian predators. Using camera systems can help elucidate nest fate patterns and predation trends across species and highlight factors such as time of predation, accurate nestling age, and interspecific interactions. Importantly, our predator-specific results suggest managers should consider techniques suitable for the suite of passerines and predators in their local ecosystems to alleviate high predation pressure, facilitate successful reproduction, and ultimately, population persistence.
RÉSUMÉ
La prédation est souvent la cause principale de l'échec des nids de passereaux ; toutefois, les causes exactes sont parfois inconnues ou peuvent être mal identifiées sur le terrain. En conséquence, il est essentiel d'améliorer notre compréhension des causes de la prédation des nids et les facteurs qui influencent le succès des nids de passereaux. Dans les dernières forêts feuillues des basses terres de l'est et du centre de l'Arkansas, nous avons observé 282 nids de passereaux pendant l'été de 2010 à 2012, dont 81 nids sur lesquels nous avons déployé des caméras vidéo. Nous avons calculé les taux de survie quotidiens (TSQ) selon les espèces, les sites et les années et avons identifié les variables temporelles, biologiques et d'habitat qui sont corrélées au succès des nids. Nous avons également estimé les taux de prédation en fonction de groupes spécifiques de prédateurs. Les espèces pour lesquelles nous disposions des échantillons les plus importants, le passerin indigo (Passerina cyanea, n = 143 nids) et le cardinal rouge (Cardinalis cardinalis, n = 97 nids), présentaient un TSQ moyen similaire (0,932 ± 0,01, 0,924 ± 0,01, respectivement). La prédation par toutes les espèces et le parasitisme par les vachers à tête brune (Molothrus ater) réunis étaient les causes les plus fréquentes de l'échec des nids (29 % et 33 % respectivement), même si le serpent ratier noir (Pantherophis obsoletus) était le prédateur le plus répandu (37 % des événements de prédation connus). L'emplacement des nids et le nombre d'enchevêtrements de lianes sont les éléments qui expliquent le mieux les variations de TSQ ; toutefois, les indicateurs de taux de prédation variaient selon les groupes de prédateurs. Par exemple, la densité de la végétation affectait de manière négative la probabilité de prédation des nids par des serpents et des mammifères, mais influait de manière positive sur la probabilité de prédation des nids par les vachers à tête brune, tout en restant sans effet sur la probabilité de prédation des nids par d'autres oiseaux prédateurs. L'utilisation de caméras peut contribuer à élucider les modèles de sort des nids et les tendances de prédation selon les espèces et mettre en évidence des facteurs tels que l'heure de prédation, l'âge exact des oisillons et les interactions entre les espèces. Plus important, nos résultats spécifiques aux prédateurs suggèrent que les responsables devraient envisager des techniques adaptées à la surveillance des passereaux et des prédateurs dans leurs écosystèmes locaux afin d'alléger la pression liée à la forte prédation et de faciliter la reproduction et finalement, la survie de la population.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art19/ACE-ECO-2021-1897.pdf,ace-eco.org,brush-warbler,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-9.94810517323923,"['molothrus ater', 'passerina cyanea', 'ou', 'cardinalis cardinalis']",170

This dichotomy is reflected in the morphology and fiber types of the forelimb muscles. In mammals, the forelimb musculature forms a “pectoral sling” that suspends the trunk. Since mammals use the same muscles for postural and dynamic movements, their muscles possess a combination of slow and fast-contracting muscle fiber types that function in postural and dynamic activities. In a specific muscle, slow muscle fibers can perform postural actions via isometric contraction with minimal fatigue, whereas fast fibers can elicit dynamic, rapid, and forceful actions for locomotion. In contrast, the forelimb muscles of birds need only hold the wing folded while not in use. The muscles specialized for avian forelimb posture are comparatively small and consist entirely of slow fibers, and likely do not function in locomotion. In soaring birds, muscles with slow fibers also function isometrically and maintain the outstretched wing for extended lengths of time. Thus birds and mammals have evolved different strategies to deal with their forelimb postures and have different muscles specialized for posture.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-019-01678-3.pdf,link.springer.com,nené,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-9.95074703973492,,1058

This is particularly true on the 86% of boreal Alaska that is managed as state and federal protected areas (45%) and multiple-use lands (41%). We review activities by governmental and ENGO programs as well as existing laws that directly or indirectly benefit birds in boreal Alaska, not all of which are well known to avian scientists and resource managers. In doing so we highlight examples of multiorganizational efforts that are advancing conservation and management of bird populations in the boreal region, as well as changes in government policies that influence how important statutes protecting birds can be used. We also point out several information gaps, such as identifying and mapping important areas and habitats for bird species of conservation concern, that could inform important land-use decisions in the region. Given the growing number of future challenges, in particular, the response of ecosystems and birds to a warming climate, international and cross-agency collaborations will be needed to anticipate and mitigate avian declines, as well as to maintain connectivity and ecosystem integrity across boreal landscapes.

L'Alaska est l'hôte de 11 % de la forêt boréale d'Amérique du Nord, réseau le plus élargi de terres protégées sur le continent, et de plusieurs espèces d'oiseaux boréaux en diminution, en faisant une composante essentielle de la conservation et de la gestion des oiseaux boréaux.

The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats because of anthropogenic activities are major threats to biodiversity worldwide. In recent decades, vast mosaics of natural and seminatural habitats have been transformed into fragmented agricultural landscapes in Inner Mongolia, China, with potential negative effects on avian diversity. We quantified the effect of local and landscape habitat attributes on the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities in Inner Mongolian grasslands. We considered eight independent habitat variables obtained by variance inflation factor analysis. We used canonical correspondence analysis to determine how these habitat factors of multiple scales explained variance in species composition. We then fitted Bayesian generalized additive models to analyze the habitat-biodiversity relationships and included a smooth effect of land cover richness to test the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in each model. Our results provided evidence that differences in bird assemblages can be explained, in part, by differences in local and landscape-scale habitat features. The responses of the four diversity indices to these predictors were diverse and scale-dependent. We found species richness and Shannon diversity exhibited similar response, with both being negatively related to bare land percentage while being positively related to plant canopy and impervious surface percentage. Phylogenetic diversity was positively associated with plant richness while negatively associated with forest percentage and impervious surface percentage. We found no statistical evidence for a relationship between functional diversity and any of the variables examined here. Additionally, for the four measures of bird diversity, we did not find any evidence that they peaked at intermediate levels of habitat disturbance. We propose that assessments of regional grassland bird communities should be conducted at multiple scales and that a range of biodiversity metrics are required to better evaluate and inform conservation decision making, especially when the target is preserving not only species but also their evolutionary history and ecological functions.
RÉSUMÉ
La perte et la fragmentation des habitats naturels causées par les activités anthropiques représentent des menaces importantes pour la biodiversité dans le monde entier. Au cours des dernières décennies, de vastes mosaïques d'habitats naturels et semi-naturels ont été transformées en paysages agricoles fragmentés en Mongolie-Intérieure (Chine), entrainant possiblement des effets négatifs sur la diversité aviaire. Nous avons quantifié l'effet des caractéristiques d'habitat aux échelles locale et du paysage sur la diversité taxonomique, fonctionnelle et phylogénétique des communautés d'oiseaux dans les prairies de la Mongolie-Intérieure. Nous avons considéré huit variables indépendantes d'habitat obtenues par l'analyse des facteurs d'inflation de la variance. Nous avons réalisé une analyse canonique des correspondances pour déterminer de quelle façon ces variables d'habitat expliquaient la variance de la composition des espèces à plusieurs échelles. Nous avons ensuite bâti des modèles additifs généralisés bayésiens pour analyser les relations habitat-biodiversité et avons utilisé un lissage de la richesse de l'occupation du sol pour tester l'hypothèse de la perturbation intermédiaire pour chaque modèle. Nos résultats ont montré que les différences dans les assemblages d'oiseaux peuvent être expliquées, en partie, par les différences dans les caractéristiques d'habitat aux échelles locale et du paysage. La réponse des quatre indices de diversité à ces variables explicatives était variée et dépendait de l'échelle. Nous avons constaté que la richesse des espèces et la diversité de Shannon présentaient des réponses similaires, les deux étant négativement reliées au pourcentage de sol dénudé tout en étant positivement reliées au pourcentage de couvert végétal et de surface imperméable. La diversité phylogénétique était positivement associée à la richesse des plantes, mais négativement associée au pourcentage de forêts et de surface imperméable. Nous n'avons trouvé aucun lien statistique attestant d'une relation entre la diversité fonctionnelle et l'une des variables examinées. De plus, nous n'avons pas observé que les quatre mesures de la diversité d'oiseaux atteignaient un sommet à des niveaux intermédiaires de perturbation d'habitat. Nous pensons que les évaluations des communautés régionales d'oiseaux de prairie devraient être menées à des échelles multiples et qu'il serait nécessaire d'établir une série de mesures de la biodiversité pour mieux orienter la prise de décision en matière de conservation, en particulier lorsque l'objectif est de non seulement de préserver les espèces, mais aussi leur histoire évolutive et leurs fonctions écologiques.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art3/ACE-ECO-2020-1745.pdf,ace-eco.org,hill-warbler,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-9.95875016618903,,474

The ultrastructure of eggshell was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). According to SEM results, eggs from precocial birds (chicken, turkey, quail, duck, ostrich, and goose) had cuticle on the eggshells, while eggs from altricial birds (pigeon, budgerigar, munia, and canary) did not. The environment/selection pressure may induce the divergent evolution process in eggs of precocial and altricial birds. The E. coli experiment results showed that chicken, turkey, quail, duck, and goose eggs, with a high cuticle opacity, exhibited a much lower E. coli penetration rate. In contrast, the eggs with poor (ostrich) or without (pigeon, budgerigar, munia, and canary) cuticle exhibited a higher penetration rate. It is suggested that cuticle is a main barrier against bacterial penetration in precocial birds’ eggs. Turkey and quail eggs showed the lowest E. coli contamination rate (3.33% and 2.22%, respectively), probably because of the tightly connected nanosphere structure on their cuticle. As for altricial birds’ eggs, the eggs of budgerigar, munia, and canary with small pore diameter (0.57 to 1.22 μm) had a lower E. coli penetration rate than pigeon eggs (45.56%, 66.67%, 50%, and 97.78%, respectively, P < 0.05), indicating that pore diameter played a significant role in defending against bacterial trans-shell invasion. We found that eggshell thickness and pore area decreased with egg size. The cuticle quality had no relationship with egg size, but was closely related to the bird species. The E. coli penetration rate of altricial birds’ eggs was significantly higher than that of precocial birds’ eggs, mainly because the pores are exposed on the eggshell surface and cuticle protection is absent. This study provides detailed information on the eggshell cuticle, which gives insight into the cuticle evolution process that occurred in precocial and altricial bird species.

Anthropogenic changes to landscapes associated with intensive agriculture often have deleterious effects on avian abundance.

We investigated the influence of winter habitat use on spring body condition in Lesser Snow Goose, a species that has increased in population following expansion into agriculturally based winter habitats. We used stable isotope measurements of four elements (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S) to determine likely prior winter habitat use of snow geese collected during spring migration across Arkansas, Missouri, and Nebraska in 2016. We evaluated differences in body size, lipid, and protein reserves from individuals with isotope values that suggested winter habitat use in traditional coastal marsh and non-coastal /agriculture habitat. Inferred winter habitat influenced total body lipid levels in snow geese collected during spring migration. Adult and juvenile individuals inferred to have overwintered in coastal marsh (n = 60) had, on average, 33.4 g (95% Confidence Interval: 0.4 g, 66.4 g) less lipid than counterparts wintering in non-coastal / agricultural habitat (n = 77). Waterfowl foods found in marshes typically have low true metabolizable energy values as a consequence of their high fiber content, which likely increases daily consumption rates. Increased energy expenditure related to greater time spent foraging, paired with lower energetic rewards, may result in lower lipid reserves among geese using coastal marsh habitats compared to birds using agricultural landscapes. Consequently, carry-over effects based on winter habitat use could explain variation in lipid reserves among individuals during spring migration and may ultimately explain differential fitness rates or susceptibility to harvest. Our results have implications for the conservation and management of this species as historic wetland landscapes become more intensively converted and used for agricultural purposes.

The neck morphology of birds is the most variable among living tetrapods, including significant differences in the number and shape of the cervical vertebrae. Despite these differences, according to the literature, three morphofunctional regions (i.e., modules) have been identified along the neck. However, this regionalization has not been quantitatively tested through a geometric morphometric approach applied to the cervical vertebrae. Based on the examination of 187 cervical vertebrae belonging to 16 species with various ecologies, we revealed a common modular structure of the neck using 3D surface geometric morphometrics. We adopted an approach without a priori clustering to identify modules along the neck. The phylogenetic influence on each module was tested. Then, each module was digitally reconstructed as a 3D vertebral model, and postural characteristics were studied. We characterized 9 modules: 7 are transpecific, being shared by at least 2 and up to 15 species. Two modules are specific to species with particularly long necks. The modularity pattern appears to be tightly linked to morphofunctional aspects and partially to phylogeny. In contrast, feeding ecology seems to be more closely related to the chaining of modules (the neck) than to the modules themselves. A study of postural properties revealed that each modular unit exhibits a characteristic curvature. Overall, the modular structure of the neck corresponds to the three traditional functional regions. However, the results also revealed unexpected pattern complexity, including subdivisions within these regions. The study of the patterns of modularity is therefore a relevant approach for challenging the three-functional-region hypothesis and allowed us to identify the structure of the diversity of the necks of birds.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11692-020-09495-w.pdf,link.springer.com,xavier,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.003404685377,,763

Visual openness is a key element in habitat selection for many animals of grasslands and other open habitats, especially birds. Obstructions to visual openness in the form of human infrastructure or inopportune woody vegetation growth can lead to habitat avoidance, and thus pose conservation challenges. Here we introduce a remotely sensed, lidar-based index of visual openness. Like previous indices of visual openness, ours is based on the vertical angle to the horizon; however, its calculation from remotely sensed data allows it to be easily mapped across the landscape. We illustrate its potential usage by calculating the index multiple ways within two large fields in central New Jersey, USA, and evaluating the effects of openness on habitat use by a grassland bird, the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), within an occupancy modeling framework. We used the best performing model and digitally edited openness maps to project population responses under five hypothetical management scenarios of increased habitat openness. Occupancy modeling revealed that a version of the index calculated based on the maximum angle to the horizon best explained Grasshopper Sparrow occupancy patterns. Models also revealed that Grasshopper Sparrows showed a negative response to openness reductions caused by both powerlines and trees. Predictions based on the increased openness scenarios indicated that removal of tree lines and powerlines could increase patch-level occupancy of the sparrows in the affected fields by up to 15% and 9%, respectively. Where adequate data exist, this index has the potential to facilitate the study of openness-habitat use relationships in a variety of open-dwelling fauna and in a variety of habitats, from tundra to marshes to grasslands. Notably, it has promising potential for use in modeling habitat suitability and projecting potential impacts in response to anthropogenic changes in visual openness, such as wind farms, power infrastructure, or vegetation management.
RÉSUMÉ
L'ouverture visuelle est un élément clé dans la sélection de l'habitat pour de nombreux animaux de prairies et autres milieux ouverts, en particulier les oiseaux. Les obstructions de celle-ci, sous forme d'infrastructures humaines ou de croissance de la végétation ligneuse, peuvent conduire à l'évitement de l'habitat et poser ainsi des problèmes de conservation. Dans la présente étude, nous proposons un indice d'ouverture visuelle fondé sur la télédétection et le LiDAR. Comme d'autres indices d'ouverture visuelle, le nôtre est basé sur l'angle vertical par rapport à l'horizon; cependant, son calcul à partir de données de télédétection permet de le cartographier facilement dans le paysage. Nous illustrons son utilisation potentielle en calculant l'indice de plusieurs façons dans deux grands champs du centre du New Jersey, aux États-Unis, et en évaluant les effets de l'ouverture sur l'utilisation de l'habitat par un oiseau de prairies, le Bruant sauterelle (Ammodramus savannarum), dans un cadre de modélisation de la présence. Nous avons utilisé le modèle le plus performant et des cartes d'ouverture éditées numériquement pour projeter les réactions de la population sous cinq scénarios de gestion hypothétiques d'augmentation de l'ouverture de l'habitat. La modélisation de la présence a révélé qu'une version de l'indice calculée sur la base de l'angle maximal par rapport à l'horizon expliquait le mieux les profils de présence du Bruant sauterelle. Les modèles ont également révélé que les bruants réagissaient négativement aux réductions de l'ouverture causées par les lignes électriques et les arbres. Les prévisions basées sur les scénarios d'ouverture accrue ont indiqué que l'élimination de rangées d'arbres et de lignes électriques pourrait favoriser l'augmentation de la présence des bruants à l'échelle des îlots dans les champs étudiés de 15 % et de 9 %, respectivement. Lorsque les données adéquates existent, cet indice peut faciliter l'étude des relations entre l'ouverture et l'utilisation de l'habitat chez une variété de faune vivant en milieu ouvert et dans une diversité d'habitats, de la toundra aux marais en passant par les prairies. Il présente notamment un potentiel prometteur pour la modélisation de la qualité de l'habitat et la projection des impacts potentiels consécutifs aux changements anthropiques de l'ouverture visuelle, tels que les parcs éoliens, les infrastructures électriques ou la gestion de la végétation.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art16/ACE-ECO-2021-2078.pdf,ace-eco.org,go-away-bird,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0155308839362,"['grasshopper sparrow', 'ammodramus savannarum', 'ou']",19

Many studies of reproductive success in North American songbirds have focused on nesting success, while relatively few have evaluated breeding-season adult survival and post-fledging survival. Grassland songbirds are among North America's most rapidly declining avian groups, and knowledge of factors that influence vital rates is needed to address declines, develop management strategies, and accurately model population limitation. We concurrently monitored nesting success, breeding-season adult survival, and post-fledging survival of two grassland obligates, Baird's Sparrow and Grasshopper sparrow, breeding in western North Dakota and northeastern Montana. Nesting success was monitored by locating and visiting nests at regular intervals while adult and post-fledging survival were assessed by daily telemetry tracking of radio-tagged birds. We analyzed the three variables using logistic exposure and modeled climate, temporal, and vegetative covariates to explain variation in rates. Cumulative nesting success, breeding-season adult survival, and post-fledging survival were 37%, 78%, and 25%, respectively, for Baird's Sparrow and 16%, 74%, and 55% for Grasshopper Sparrow. Both nesting success and post-fledging survival in Baird's Sparrow were responsive to environmental covariates including temporal effects and vertical vegetation structure. Conversely, vital rates of Grasshopper Sparrow were largely unresponsive to covariates we modeled, perhaps because of the species' broader habitat niche relative to Baird's Sparrow. Breeding season adult survival in both species showed little annual variation and was high relative to overwintering survival estimates for the same species, while post-fledging survival in Baird's Sparrow was low and may be a management concern. We suggest as a next step the formal comparison of vital rates across life-stages in an integrated population model capable of identifying sources of population limitation throughout the full annual cycle of the species.
RÉSUMÉ
De nombreuses études sur le succès de reproduction des passereaux d'Amérique du Nord se sont penchées sur le succès de nidification, mais relativement peu d'études ont évalué la survie des adultes en période de nidification et la survie après l'envol. Les passereaux de prairie font partie des groupes d'oiseaux qui diminuent le plus rapidement en Amérique du Nord et il est nécessaire de connaître les facteurs qui influent sur les taux vitaux pour renverser les déclins, élaborer des stratégies de gestion et modéliser avec précision ce qui limite les populations. Nous avons suivi simultanément le succès de nidification, la survie des adultes pendant la saison de reproduction et la survie après l'envol chez deux espèces spécialistes de prairie, le Bruant de Baird et le Bruant sauterelle, se reproduisant dans l'ouest du Dakota du Nord et le nord-est du Montana. Le succès de nidification a été mesuré en localisant et visitant les nids à intervalles réguliers, tandis que la survie des adultes et la survie après l'envol ont été calculées au moyen du suivi télémétrique quotidien d'oiseaux munis d'un émetteur. Nous avons analysé ces trois variables au moyen de l'exposition logistique et modélisé les covariables climatiques, temporelles et végétales pour expliquer la variation des taux. Le succès cumulatif de la nidification, la survie des adultes en saison de reproduction et la survie après l'envol étaient respectivement de 37 %, 78 % et 25 % pour le Bruant de Baird, et de 16 %, 74 % et 55 % pour le Bruant sauterelle. Le succès de nidification et la survie après l'envol du Bruant de Baird étaient sensibles aux covariables environnementales, y compris les effets temporels et la structure verticale de la végétation. À l'inverse, les taux vitaux du Bruant sauterelle ne variaient pas en fonction des covariables que nous avons modélisées, peut-être en raison de la niche d'habitat plus élargie de cette espèce comparativement au Bruant de Baird. La survie des adultes en saison de reproduction chez les deux espèces a montré peu de variation annuelle et était élevée par rapport à leur taux de survie en hiver, tandis que la survie après l'envol chez le Bruant de Baird était faible et devrait peut-être être une préoccupation à prioriser.

We suggest as a next step the formal comparison of vital rates across life-stages in an integrated population model capable of identifying sources of population limitation throughout the full annual cycle of the species.
RÉSUMÉ
De nombreuses études sur le succès de reproduction des passereaux d'Amérique du Nord se sont penchées sur le succès de nidification, mais relativement peu d'études ont évalué la survie des adultes en période de nidification et la survie après l'envol. Les passereaux de prairie font partie des groupes d'oiseaux qui diminuent le plus rapidement en Amérique du Nord et il est nécessaire de connaître les facteurs qui influent sur les taux vitaux pour renverser les déclins, élaborer des stratégies de gestion et modéliser avec précision ce qui limite les populations. Nous avons suivi simultanément le succès de nidification, la survie des adultes pendant la saison de reproduction et la survie après l'envol chez deux espèces spécialistes de prairie, le Bruant de Baird et le Bruant sauterelle, se reproduisant dans l'ouest du Dakota du Nord et le nord-est du Montana. Le succès de nidification a été mesuré en localisant et visitant les nids à intervalles réguliers, tandis que la survie des adultes et la survie après l'envol ont été calculées au moyen du suivi télémétrique quotidien d'oiseaux munis d'un émetteur. Nous avons analysé ces trois variables au moyen de l'exposition logistique et modélisé les covariables climatiques, temporelles et végétales pour expliquer la variation des taux. Le succès cumulatif de la nidification, la survie des adultes en saison de reproduction et la survie après l'envol étaient respectivement de 37 %, 78 % et 25 % pour le Bruant de Baird, et de 16 %, 74 % et 55 % pour le Bruant sauterelle. Le succès de nidification et la survie après l'envol du Bruant de Baird étaient sensibles aux covariables environnementales, y compris les effets temporels et la structure verticale de la végétation. À l'inverse, les taux vitaux du Bruant sauterelle ne variaient pas en fonction des covariables que nous avons modélisées, peut-être en raison de la niche d'habitat plus élargie de cette espèce comparativement au Bruant de Baird. La survie des adultes en saison de reproduction chez les deux espèces a montré peu de variation annuelle et était élevée par rapport à leur taux de survie en hiver, tandis que la survie après l'envol chez le Bruant de Baird était faible et devrait peut-être être une préoccupation à prioriser. Comme prochaine étape, nous proposons de comparer de façon formelle les taux vitaux à travers les étapes de vie dans un modèle de population intégré permettant d'identifier les facteurs qui limitent les populations tout au long du cycle annuel complet de ces deux espèces.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art19/ACE-ECO-2021-1875.pdf,ace-eco.org,cardinal,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.028127957149,['grasshopper sparrow'],323

Although excess ROS reduces lifespan by causing extensive cellular dysfunction and damage, birds are remarkably long-lived. We address this paradox by identifying the constitutive activation of the NRF2 master antioxidant response in Neoaves (~95% of bird species), providing an adaptive mechanism capable of counterbalancing high ROS levels. We demonstrate that a KEAP1 mutation in the Neoavian ancestor disrupted the repression of NRF2 by KEAP1, leading to constitutive NRF2 activity and decreased oxidative stress in wild Neoaves tissues and cells. Our evidence suggests this ancient mutation induced a compensatory program in NRF2-target genes with functions beyond redox regulation—including feather development—while enabling significant metabolic rate increases that avoid trade-offs with lifespan. The strategy of NRF2 activation sought by intense clinical investigation therefore appears to have also unlocked a massively successful evolutionary trajectory. Fast metabolisms tend to shorten lifespans by increasing oxidative damage. This study identifies a gene mutation that keeps a key antioxidant response active, possibly allowing Neoaves bird species to avoid the tradeoff between rapid metabolism and longevity that challenges most mammals, including humans.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16129-4.pdf,nature.com,cut-throat,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0373484067787,,702

To conserve small and fragmented populations, we need an understanding of their population dynamics. With a global population estimate of < 120,000, Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is considered one of the Nearctic-Neotropical migrants at greatest risk of extinction. This range-restricted songbird breeds in high-elevation fir (Abies balsamea) forests of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, and primarily overwinters in forests of the Dominican Republic. The Conservation Action Plan for Bicknell’s Thrush identifies numerous actions that may help stem population declines and promote recovery of the species, yet the empirical data needed to prioritize among these actions are lacking. We fit Cormack-Jolly-Seber models with mark-recapture data to test a series of hypotheses about the factors that limit apparent survival in 178 adult Bicknell’'s Thrush (50 females and 128 males) captured on the breeding grounds in Vermont (June-July, 2001-2015). We focused on putatively important factors from throughout their annual cycle: cyclical population dynamics of nest predators, and weather effects on food abundance on the breeding and wintering grounds. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was relatively stable (mean Φ = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.68) over our 15-year study, and most strongly associated with fir mast production. Apparent survival was higher following years during which fir trees produced large mast crops (mean Φ = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79), compared to following nonmast years (Φ = 0.56 ± 0.06, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.68). These results are likely driven by the reduced red squirrel density and increased nesting success and site fidelity of adult thrushes following nonmast years. Apparent survival of Bicknell’s Thrush was also associated with relatively wet conditions on the wintering grounds in Hispaniola as assessed via the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) precipitation index (ESPI). These relatively wet December-March periods are likely linked to greater primary productivity and the local availability of fruits and arthropods consumed by Bicknell’s Thrush. Our research provides the most comprehensive examination of potentially limiting factors on Bicknell’s Thrush populations to date and suggests future avenues of research exploring the relationship between food availability, survival, and climate change induced reductions in rainfall for the Greater Antilles.
RÉSUMÉ
Il est important de comprendre la dynamique des petites populations fragmentées si on veut conserver leur population. La Grive de Bicknell (Catharus bicknelli), dont la population mondiale est estimée à < 120 000, est considérée comme l'une des espèces migratrices néarctiques-néotropicales les plus à risque d'extinction. Cet oiseau chanteur à répartition restreinte niche dans les sapinières (Abies balsamea) de haute altitude dans le nord-est des États-Unis et l'est du Canada, et hiverne principalement dans les forêts de la République dominicaine. Le plan d'action destiné à la conservation de la Grive de Bicknell liste de nombreuses activités qui pourraient contribuer à freiner les baisses de population et promouvoir le rétablissement de l'espèce, mais les données empiriques nécessaires pour établir quelles activités sont prioritaires sont manquantes. Au moyen de données de marquage-recapture, nous avons conçu des modèles de Cormack-Jolly-Seber pour tester une série d'hypothèses quant aux facteurs qui pourraient limiter la survie apparente de 178 Grives de Bicknell adultes (50 femelles et 128 mâles) capturées sur des sites de nidification au Vermont (juin et juillet, 2001-2015). Nous nous sommes concentrés sur les facteurs supposément importants dans l'ensemble du cycle annuel : dynamique de population cyclique des prédateurs de nids et effets du temps sur la quantité de nourriture aux sites de nidification et d'hivernage. La survie apparente des grives a été relativement stable (Φ moyenne = 0,61; IC à 95 % = 0,54 et 0,68) durant les 15 années de l'étude et a été le plus fortement associée avec la production de cônes par les sapins. La survie apparente a été le plus élevée à la suite d'années de forte production de cônes (Φ moyenne = 0,67; IC à 95 % = 0,55 et 0,79), comparativement à la survie à la suite d'années sans production de cônes (Φ = 0,56 ± 0,06; IC à 95 % = 0,43 et 0,68). Ces résultats sont certainement influencés par la densité réduite d'écureuils roux, le meilleur succès de nidification et la fidélité plus grande des adultes au site suivant les années sans production de cônes. La survie apparente de la Grive de Bicknell était aussi associée avec des conditions relativement humides sur les aires d'hivernage sur l'île d'Hispaniola, telles qu'établies par l'indice de précipitation (ESPI) El Niño-oscillation australe (ENSO). Ces périodes relativement humides en décembre-mars sont vraisemblablement liées à une plus grande productivité primaire et à la disponibilité locale de fruits et d'arthropodes consommés par la Grive de Bicknell. Notre recherche représente l'examen le plus complet des facteurs limitant possiblement les populations de Grives de Bicknell jusqu'à maintenant, et propose des axes de recherche explorant la relation entre la disponibilité de nourriture, la survie et la diminution des précipitations induite par les changements climatiques pour les Grandes Antilles.PDF_BREAK",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art16/ACE-ECO-2019-1462.pdf,ace-eco.org,thrasher,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0463096510028,['catharus bicknelli'],901

Eiders with small uropygial glands grew their feathers at a fast rate. Eiders with large wing areas had large uropygial glands. These findings are consistent with large uropygial glands playing a role in water-proofing during molt and foraging, but also that uropygial glands may play a role in chemical defense.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0163-8,avianres.biomedcentral.com,eider,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0478207301795,"['somateria mollissima', 'eider']",1020

Eleven freshly dead, HPAI H5 virus-positive Common buzzards were necropsied.

Based on histology and immunohistochemistry, the most common virus-associated pathological changes were necrotizing encephalitis (9/11 birds) and necrotizing myocarditis (7/11 birds).

We also demonstrate an expected protandrous migratory pattern and an unexpected sex-dependent difference in migration speed with females migrating more quickly than males. Our analyses of longitudinal timing patterns reveal that passage through sites west of 85° occurs prior to passage at sites east of 85° and that this difference increases throughout the migratory period, indicating that birds using western sites are migrating faster. Additionally, we provide evidence vis-à-vis analyses of wing length that birds from eastern and western breeding locations mix at lower-latitude migratory sites but their migratory paths diverge as birds proceed north. These results indicate that birds migrating to western breeding sites differ in their migration speed and route thus compensating for the longer migratory distances traveled by western populations of Blackpoll Warblers compared to those breeding in eastern North America.

There are many gaps in our understanding of Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) life history especially as it relates to nesting ecology. Our objective was to determine habitat features selected by Gray Vireos for nesting to improve management strategies for breeding populations. We searched for Gray Vireo nests on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico from 2016 to 2017. We estimated Gray Vireo nest-site selection at the tree level, the surrounding vegetation, and at two broader scales corresponding to selection within territories. Nest-site selection was estimated for 99 Gray Vireo nests. For tree-level selection, we compared characteristics of nesting trees with mean characteristics from groups of six randomly selected one-seed junipers (Juniperus monosperma) within a 25-m radius. We also compared overall vegetation characteristics at the 25-m scale for nesting plots and 66 randomly selected plots. Broad-scale cover proportions of nest sites and random points were estimated at 50- and 100-m radius spatial scales using a geographic information system. Gray Vireos selected nesting trees that were taller and wider than other adjacent junipers. Selection of vegetation characteristics surrounding nests showed a similar pattern, where Gray Vireos nested in areas where junipers were taller, wider, and had greater foliage density than was randomly available. Broad-scale analyses suggested that Gray Vireos selected nest sites in areas with higher proportions of junipers at low elevations (< 1954 m), and lower proportions of junipers in higher elevations (> 1954 m); however, juniper proportions at nest sites consistently ranged from 15 to 30% of available cover. Gray Vireos also tended to select areas with less pinyon pine than what was randomly available at the 100-m radius scale. Future management strategies should provide large patches of old-growth juniper to optimize Gray Vireo nesting habitat.

There are many gaps in our understanding of Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) life history especially as it relates to nesting ecology. Our objective was to determine habitat features selected by Gray Vireos for nesting to improve management strategies for breeding populations. We searched for Gray Vireo nests on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico from 2016 to 2017. We estimated Gray Vireo nest-site selection at the tree level, the surrounding vegetation, and at two broader scales corresponding to selection within territories. Nest-site selection was estimated for 99 Gray Vireo nests. For tree-level selection, we compared characteristics of nesting trees with mean characteristics from groups of six randomly selected one-seed junipers (Juniperus monosperma) within a 25-m radius. We also compared overall vegetation characteristics at the 25-m scale for nesting plots and 66 randomly selected plots. Broad-scale cover proportions of nest sites and random points were estimated at 50- and 100-m radius spatial scales using a geographic information system. Gray Vireos selected nesting trees that were taller and wider than other adjacent junipers. Selection of vegetation characteristics surrounding nests showed a similar pattern, where Gray Vireos nested in areas where junipers were taller, wider, and had greater foliage density than was randomly available. Broad-scale analyses suggested that Gray Vireos selected nest sites in areas with higher proportions of junipers at low elevations (< 1954 m), and lower proportions of junipers in higher elevations (> 1954 m); however, juniper proportions at nest sites consistently ranged from 15 to 30% of available cover. Gray Vireos also tended to select areas with less pinyon pine than what was randomly available at the 100-m radius scale. Future management strategies should provide large patches of old-growth juniper to optimize Gray Vireo nesting habitat.

As a consequence, (co)amplification of untargeted bacterial sequences has been occasionally reported as a common problem in DNA barcoding. While identifying amphipod species with universal COI primers, we unexpectedly detected rickettsial endosymbionts belonging to the Torix group. To map the distribution and diversity of Rickettsia species among amphipod hosts, we conducted a nationwide molecular screening of seven families of New Zealand freshwater amphipods. In addition to uncovering a diversity of Torix Rickettsia species across multiple amphipod populations from three different families, our research indicates that: (1) detecting Torix Rickettsia with universal primers is not uncommon, (2) obtaining ‘Rickettsia COI sequences’ from many host individuals is highly likely when a population is infected, and (3) obtaining ‘host COI’ may not be possible with a conventional PCR if an individual is infected. Because Rickettsia COI is highly conserved across diverse host taxa, we were able to design blocking primers that can be used in a wide range of host species infected with Torix Rickettsia. We propose the use of blocking primers to circumvent problems caused by unwanted amplification of Rickettsia and to obtain targeted host COI sequences for DNA barcoding, population genetics, and phylogeographic studies.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73986-1.pdf,nature.com,bengalí,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0636386493364,,559

Powerline collisions have been identified on Kaua'i as a potential contributing factor to the large-scale decline of both Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and Newell's Shearwater (Puffinus newelli), but the scale of the powerline collision problem is unknown. From 2012 to 2020 we conducted observations for seabird powerline collisions across Kaua'i, documented grounded seabirds, and assessed crippling and environmental biases - both poorly studied facets of powerline collision research. We directly observed 121 powerline collisions and detected 89 grounded seabirds. While some collisions resulted in birds falling lifelessly out of the sky, most resulted in seabirds flying or gliding outside of the search area. This means that traditional ground searches would underestimate total collisions by 78-88% if not accounting for crippling bias. We tested environmental bias by comparing our ability to conduct searches for grounded birds, ""searchability"", across multiple variables. Environmental bias resulted in significant reductions in searchability across regions, environment types, and powerline heights. Furthermore, observed collision rates were significantly higher at powerlines that had very low to zero searchability. Forty-three percent of observed collisions occurred at unsearchable powerlines (mainly spanning steep valleys), equating to an estimated 3170 seabird collisions that could not be detected through ground searches. We detected powerline collisions in every region of Kaua'i, in every environment type, and at all powerline heights monitored. Our results show that crippling bias and environmental bias are the mechanisms that concealed the geographic distribution of collisions and the scale of the powerline problem from grounded bird searches, ultimately preventing the detection of thousands of collisions. The data collected for this study are critical for assessing the scale of seabird powerline collisions and quantifying the biases inherent in traditional ground searches.
RÉSUMÉ
Les collisions avec les lignes électriques sur Kaua'i ont été identifiées comme facteur contribuant potentiellement à la baisse à grande échelle du Pétrel des Hawaï (Pterodroma sandwichensis) et du Puffin de Newell (Puffinus newelli), mais l'ampleur de ce problème est inconnue. De 2012 à 2020, nous avons été témoins de collisions d'oiseaux marins avec des lignes électriques sur Kaua'i, documenté les oiseaux marins trouvés au sol et évalué les biais inhérents aux blessures et à l'environnement - deux facettes peu étudiées dans les études sur les collisions avec les lignes électriques. Nous avons assisté à 121 collisions avec des lignes électriques et détecté 89 oiseaux marins morts au sol. Si certaines collisions ont été fatales sur le coup pour les oiseaux marins, la plupart des oiseaux ont continué à voler ou à planer en dehors de la zone de recherche. Ce résultat indique que les recherches traditionnelles d'oiseaux morts au sol sous-estimeraient le nombre de collisions de 78 à 88 % si l'on ne tenait pas compte du biais inhérent aux blessures. Nous avons testé le biais environnemental en comparant notre capacité à effectuer des recherches d'oiseaux au sol, la « facilité de recherche », selon de nombreuses variables. Le biais environnemental s'est traduit par des réductions importantes de la facilité de recherche dans toutes les régions, les types d'environnement et la hauteur des lignes électriques. De plus, les taux de collisions observés étaient beaucoup plus élevés sur les lignes électriques dont la facilité de recherche était très faible ou nulle. Quarante-trois pourcent des collisions observées se sont produites avec des lignes électriques pour lesquelles il était impossible de faire des recherches au sol, ces lignes traversant surtout des vallées abruptes, ce qui équivaut à 3170 collisions d'oiseaux marins environ qui n'ont pas pu être détectées au moyen de recherches au sol. Nous avons détecté des collisions avec les lignes électriques dans toutes les régions de Kaua'i, dans tous les types d'environnement et à toutes les hauteurs de lignes électriques inventoriées. Nos résultats montrent que le biais inhérent aux blessures et le biais environnemental sont les mécanismes qui ont faussé la répartition géographique des collisions et l'ampleur du problème des lignes électriques étudiée à partir de recherches d'oiseaux au sol, empêchant ultimement de détecter des milliers de collisions.

These different GyV species have been reported in chickens, humans, mice, and companion animals. To date, CAV has been identified in the feces of domestic cats, while the circulation of other GyV species in cats is currently unknown. In the present study, 197 fecal samples were collected from pet cats in northeast China, and samples were screened for different GyV species by PCR. Twelve GyV strains were identified from the feces of pet cats. These included 4 positive for CAV, 3 for HGyV/AGV2, 3 for GyV3 and 2 positive for GyV6. The complete genome sequences of the 12 cat-sourced GyV strains showed 93.9–99.7% nucleotide identities to the homologous reference GyV strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genomes, VP1, VP2 and VP3 genes showed the identical classification of GyV species with previous reports. Moreover, one and four unique amino acid substitutions were identified in the VP1 protein of the cat-sourced HGyV/AGV2 and GyV6 strains, respectively, and one substitution was also observed in the VP2 protein of one GyV6 strain identified in this study. In conclusion, our investigation demonstrates that the diverse GyV species were circulating in domestic cats, and provides the first molecular evidence for the circulation of HGyV/AGV2, GyV3 and GyV6 in domestic cats. These cat-origin GyVs possessed considerable genetic diversity.

Encroachment, including human settlement, into the North American boreal forest has increased substantially in recent decades. This has resulted in changes in the dynamics, distribution, and functioning of this system with potential negative implications for avifaunal communities. Fuel breaks are often constructed around human settlements in forested landscapes to reduce the potential of damage to infrastructure from wildfires. The frequency and intensity of wildfire in boreal landscapes is projected to increase under future climate change scenarios. Thus, fuel breaks may become a more common management system around communities in the boreal forest. We assessed the responses of 21 bird species to the creation of a fuel break constructed around the village of Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada. We surveyed birds for 2 years before (2000, 2001) and in 11 of 16 years after clearing (2002-2017; n = 14 sites) relative to reference sites (n = 3 sites surveyed since 2000 and n = 14 sites surveyed since 2006). The fuel break (~247 ha) was created in mature aspen-spruce forests and resulted in habitats resembling open parkland and open deciduous forest through removal of ~95% of the coniferous trees and continuous firebreak management. A community-level analysis indicated that open- and shrub-dwelling bird species became dominant following fuel break creation and for the duration of the study. Individual species-level analyses indicated declines in four avian species associated with older boreal forests (e.g., Bay-breasted Warbler,Setophaga castanea) and increases of six avian species typical of open and shrub habitats (e.g., White-throated Sparrow,Zonotrichia albicollis). However, trends of most species were similar in reference and fuel break sites likely due to the close proximity of reference sites to the fuel break. The fuel break in our study negatively affected most avian species that require older forests and, with ongoing maintenance, fuel breaks represent an unnatural component of the landscape in protected areas. Planned and ongoing expansion of the Waskesiu fuel break and creation of another fuel break (additional ~395 ha) in Prince Albert National Park including clearing to protect commercial property outside the park warrant additional investigations into the impacts of fuel breaks on birds and other wildlife.
RÉSUMÉ
L'empiètement de la forêt boréale nord-américaine, y compris l'établissement de zones habitées, a augmenté substantiellement dans les récentes décennies, entraînant des changements dans la dynamique, la répartition et le fonctionnement de ce système, et de possibles répercussions négatives sur les communautés d'oiseaux. On construit souvent des coupe-feux autour des zones habitées dans les paysages forestiers pour y réduire le risque de dommages aux infrastructures par les feux de forêt. Selon des scénarios prédisant les effets des changements climatiques futurs, la fréquence et l'intensité des feux de forêt dans les paysages boréaux augmenteront. Les coupe-feux vont dès lors probablement devenir un système de gestion plus commun autour des communautés sises en forêt boréale. Nous avons évalué la tendance de 21 espèces d'oiseaux suivant la construction d'un coupe-feu autour du village de Waskesiu dans le parc national de Prince Albert, en Saskatchewan, Canada. Nous avons inventorié les oiseaux deux ans avant (2000 et 2001) et lors de 11 des 16 ans après la coupe forestière (2002-2017; n = 14 sites) comparativement à un site de référence (n = 3 sites inventoriés depuis 2000 et n = 14 sites inventoriés depuis 2006). Le coupe-feu (~247 ha) a été créé dans une forêt de peupliers-épinettes mature et les milieux résultant de cet aménagement ressemblaient à de la forêt-parc ouverte et de la forêt décidue ouverte, suivant la coupe de ~95 % des conifères et le maintien en continu de cette zone. Une analyse au niveau de la communauté a révélé que les espèces d'oiseaux de milieux ouverts et arbustifs sont devenues dominantes à la suite de la création du coupe-feu et le sont demeurées tout au long de notre étude. Les analyses au niveau spécifique ont indiqué que quatre espèces d'oiseaux associées aux forêts boréales âgées (p. ex. la Paruline à poitrine baie, Setophaga castanea) ont diminué et que six espèces typiques des milieux ouverts et arbustifs (p. ex. le Bruant à gorge blanche, Zonotrichia albicollis) ont augmenté. Toutefois, la tendance de la plupart des espèces dans les sites de référence était la même que celle des sites localisés dans le coupe-feu, vraisemblablement en raison de la proximité des sites de référence avec le coupe-feu. Le coupe-feu sous étude a affecté négativement la plupart des espèces d'oiseaux qui ont besoin de forêts âgées et, avec leur maintien en continu, les coupe-feux représentent une composante non naturelle dans le paysage d'aires protégées. L'expansion actuelle et planifiée du coupe-feu de Waskesiu et la création prévue d'un autre coupe-feu (~395 ha) dans le parc national de Prince Albert, dont de la coupe forestière en vue de protéger des propriétés commerciales à l'extérieur du parc, méritent un examen approfondi des impacts des coupe-feux sur les oiseaux et les autres espèces fauniques.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art5/ACE-ECO-2019-1407.pdf,ace-eco.org,setophaga,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-10.080279738801046,"['setophaga castanea', 'zonotrichia albicollis']",1024

The vast majority of chickens in agriculture originate from hybrid breeding programs and is concentrated on few commercially used high performance lines, whereas numerous local and indigenous breeds are at risk to become extinct. To preserve the genomic resources of rare and endangered chicken breeds innovative methods are necessary. Here, we established a solid workflow for the derivation and biobanking of chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) from blue layer hybrids. To achieve this, embryos of a cross of heterozygous blue egg layers were sampled to obtain blood derived and gonadal male as well as female PGCs of different genotypes (homozygous, heterozygous and nullizygous blue-allele bearing). The total efficiency of established PGC lines was 45% (47/104) within an average of 49&nbsp;days until they reached sufficient numbers of cells for cryopreservation. The stem-cell character of the cultivated PGCs was confirmed by SSEA-1 immunostaining, and RT-PCR amplification of the pluripotency- and PGC-specific genes cPOUV, cNANOG, cDAZL and CVH. The Sleeping Beauty transposon system allowed to generate a stable integration of a Venus fluorophore reporter into the chicken genome. Finally, we demonstrated that, after re-transfer into chicken embryos, Venus-positive PGCs migrated and colonized the forming gonads. Semen samples of 13 raised cell chimeric roosters were analyzed by flow cytometry for the efficiency of germline colonization by the transferred PGCs carrying the Venus reporter and their proper differentiation into vital spermatids. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept study for the potential use of PGCs for the cryobanking of rare breeds or rare alleles.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91490-y.pdf,nature.com,bruja,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.0852030699962,['gallus gallus'],303

Conserving populations of species that rely on rare habitat requires that managers understand which habitat characteristics will best support population growth across multiple life stages. For songbirds, management is most often aimed at nesting adult habitat associations. However, habitat that meets adult requirements may not be similarly suited to requirements for other life stages. Henslow’s Sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) is a tallgrass prairie songbird listed as threatened or endangered in 13 states. We examined survival and habitat selection of Henslow’s Sparrow during the postfledging period. During the nesting seasons in 2015 and 2016, we attached radio transmitters to 46 nestlings in a tallgrass prairie and modeled their survival and habitat selection as a function of habitat characteristics. Thirty-five percent of fledglings survived until two weeks postfledge. Survival was negatively associated with areas of sumac (Rhus copallinum) cover, positively associated with years since last burn, and decreased as the breeding season progressed. Snakes were the most common predator of fledglings. Independent fledglings used habitat that was different than that used by adults and dependent fledglings, with habitat used during the independent period having lower litter cover and increased forb cover compared to points used during the dependent period. During the dependent period, points used by fledglings were a mean distance of 40 m (± 11 SD) from the natal nest. Following independence, points used by fledglings were 236 m (± 89 SD) from the natal nest. Henslow’s Sparrow populations may benefit from removal of encroaching sumac in tallgrass prairie, and from consideration of the varying habitats used by the species during different life stages.
RÉSUMÉ
Pour assurer la conservation de populations d'espèces qui dépendent de milieux rares, les gestionnaires doivent comprendre quelles caractéristiques influent positivement sur la croissance des populations au cours des divers stades du cycle vital. Dans le cas des oiseaux chanteurs, l'aménagement est souvent orienté sur les adultes nicheurs et leurs habitats. Toutefois, les milieux qui conviennent aux adultes ne sont pas nécessairement les mêmes que ceux qui sont utilisés durant les autres stades du cycle vital. Le Bruant de Henslow (Centronyx henslowii), oiseau chanteur de milieux de prairie à grandes graminées, figure sur la liste des oiseaux menacés ou en voie de disparition dans 13 États. Nous avons examiné la survie et la sélection d'habitat chez le Bruant de Henslow durant la période suivant l'envol des jeunes. Durant les saisons de nidification de 2015 et 2016, nous avons fixé des émetteurs radio sur 46 oisillons dans une prairie à grandes graminées et avons modélisé leur survie et leur sélection d'habitat en fonction des caractéristiques d'habitat. Trente-cinq pourcent des jeunes ayant pris leur envol ont survécu jusqu'à deux semaines après l'envol. Le taux de survie était associé négativement avec les secteurs de sumac (Rhus copallinum), positivement avec les années suivant le dernier brûlis, et diminuait au fur et à mesure que la saison de nidification progressait. Les serpents étaient le prédateur le plus commun des jeunes oiseaux. Les jeunes oiseaux indépendants ont utilisé des habitats différents de ceux utilisés par les adultes et les jeunes dépendants; les milieux fréquentés durant la période d'indépendance présentaient moins de litière et plus de plantes herbacées non graminoïdes comparativement aux endroits utilisés durant la période de dépendance. Durant cette dernière, les endroits utilisés par les jeunes étaient à une distance de 40 m (± 11 écart type) du nid d'origine. Une fois indépendants, les jeunes ont utilisé des endroits situés à 236 m (± 89 écart type) du nid.

Here, we investigate the connection between the alula and LEV attachment via flow measurements in a wind tunnel. We show that a model alula, whose wetted area is 1 % that of the wing, stabilizes a recirculatory aft-tilted LEV on a steadily translating unswept wing at post-stall angles of attack. The attached vortex is the result of the alula’s ability to smoothly merge otherwise separate leading- and side-edge vortical flows. We identify two key processes that facilitate this merging: (i) the steering of spanwise vorticity generated at the wing’s leading edge back to the wing plane and (ii) an aft-located wall jet of high-magnitude root-to-tip spanwise flow ( that of the free-stream velocity). The former feature induces LEV roll-up while the latter tilts LEV vorticity aft and evacuates this flow toward the wing tip via an outboard vorticity flux. We identify the alula’s streamwise position (relative to the leading edge of the thin wing) as important for vortex steering and the alula’s cant angle as important for high-magnitude spanwise flow generation.

Many island endemics around the world have evolved from populations of colonists. Further colonizations may lead to interactions between older and newer colonists. Little is known, however, regarding the impact of more recent island colonizers on incumbent congeners, partly because of a dearth of examples of natural colonizations in the recent past. Sardinian Warbler (Sylvia melanocephala) recently colonized Cyprus and has rapidly expanded its breeding range. We examined the impact of the Sardinian Warbler colonization on the endemic Cyprus Warbler (S. melanothorax) and on another congener, the Spectacled Warbler (S. conspicillata). We performed 402 population surveys in 32 sample plots across the island, covering five different habitat types and variation across three seasons. Our results show that Cyprus Warbler has undergone a significant decline during the five years of the study, especially in disturbed habitats, while Sardinian and Spectacled Warbler populations have remained stable. Although the longer established Spectacled Warbler clearly segregated habitat with Cyprus Warbler, Sardinian Warbler numbers were negatively associated with Cyprus Warbler abundance, suggesting its presence may contribute to the endemic’s decline. Maquis scrub was favored by both Cyprus Warbler and Sardinian Warbler, but the latter also occurred in high densities in disturbed habitats. The colonizer’s prevalence in disturbed, mixed habitat, suggests it may replace the endemic in parts of its former range following anthropogenic perturbations. Natural colonizations may contribute to rapid population declines in island endemics in a similar way to introduced species, especially when combined with strong effects of habitat disturbance.
RÉSUMÉ
De nombreuses espèces endémiques des îles du monde entier ont évolué à partir de populations colonisatrices. De nouvelles colonisations peuvent ensuite donner lieu à des interactions entre les populations récentes et plus anciennes. On en sait peu, en revanche, au sujet de l'impact des colonisateurs les plus récents des îles sur leurs congénères déjà présents, en partie en raison de la rareté des exemples de colonisations naturelles dans un passé récent. La fauvette mélanocéphale (Sylvia melanocephala) a récemment colonisé Chypre et son territoire de reproduction s'est rapidement développé. Nous avons examiné l'impact de la colonisation de fauvettes mélanocéphales sur l'espèce endémique, la fauvette de Chypre (S. melanothorax) ainsi que sur un autre congénère, la fauvette à lunettes (S. conspicillata). Nous avons réalisé 402 enquêtes sur ces populations sur 32 territoires échantillons dans l'île, couvrant cinq types d'habitats et les variations au cours de trois saisons. Nos résultats indiquent que la fauvette de Chypre a connu un déclin important au cours des cinq dernières années de l'étude, en particulier dans les habitats perturbés, alors que les populations de fauvettes mélanocéphales et de fauvettes à lunettes sont restées stables. Même si la fauvette à lunettes, établie depuis plus longtemps, présente des habitats clairement séparés de ceux de la fauvette de Chypre, l'augmentation de la population de fauvettes mélanocéphales semble avoir coïncidé avec une baisse des nombres de fauvettes de Chypre, ce qui suggère que leur présence pourrait contribuer au déclin de l'espèce endémique. La fauvette de Chypre et la fauvette mélanocéphale semblent privilégier les broussailles et le maquis, mais cette dernière est également présente en forte densité dans les habitats perturbés. La prévalence des colonisateurs dans les habitats mixtes et perturbés suggère qu'ils pourraient remplacer l'espèce endémique dans certaines parties de son ancien territoire à la suite de perturbations anthropogéniques. Les colonisations naturelles pourraient contribuer au déclin rapide de certaines populations d'oiseaux endémiques des îles au même titre que les espèces introduites, en particulier lorsque ces phénomènes sont associés aux effets majeurs de la perturbation de l'habitat.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art11/ACE-ECO-2021-1937.pdf,ace-eco.org,hill-warbler,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.115857021849,"['fauvette à lunettes', 'cyprus warbler', 'spectacled warbler', 'fauvette mélanocéphale', 'sardinian warbler']",262

Agri-environmental measures aim at mitigating the negative impacts of modern agriculture on farmland biodiversity. For example, soil management practices can positively influence the abundance and diversity of songbirds in olive groves by enhancing habitat and food availability. However, little is known about their potential implications on the breeding success of these species. We monitored nest density and breeding performance of tree-nesting birds in 17 olive groves of southern Spain under two contrasting soil management regimes (with and without herbaceous cover) over three years. We analyzed breeding success by examining the transitions between different stages of the breeding cycle for three common cardueline finches: Common Linnet (Linaria cannabina), European Greenfinch (Chloris chloris), and European Serin (Serinus serinus).

 Breeding success of songbirds was low (19% of 88 nests forL. cannabina, 16% of 196 nests forC. chloris, and 38% of 234 nests forS. serinus). Many nests were abandoned prior to egg laying and nesting failure was highest between egg laying and hatching. Nest predation (56.6%) was the main cause of nest loss. Although soil management regimes did not influence breeding success, the presence of herbaceous cover had opposing effects on nest densities of the three species: groves with herbaceous cover had higher nest densities for greenfinches, lower for serins, and this treatment had no effect on Common Linnet. Other factors, like disturbances due to management activities or interannual weather variation may have a larger impact on nesting success than soil management regimes, at least for some species and for specific stages of their breeding cycle. The fact that nest densities of some birds were negatively affected by soil treatments associated with agri-environmental actions aimed at benefiting biodiversity raises the question of the general applicability of these measures for conservation.
RÉSUMÉ
Les mesures agro-environnementales visent à atténuer les effets négatifs de l'agriculture moderne sur la biodiversité des terres agricoles. Par exemple, les pratiques de gestion des sols peuvent influer positivement sur le nombre et la diversité des oiseaux chanteurs dans les oliveraies en améliorant l'habitat et la disponibilité de nourriture. Cependant, on en sait peu sur leurs conséquences potentielles sur le succès de reproduction de ces espèces. Nous avons suivi la densité de nids et le succès de reproduction d'oiseaux nichant dans les arbres dans 17 oliveraies du sud de l'Espagne sous deux régimes opposés de gestion des sols (avec ou sans couvert herbacé) pendant trois ans. Nous avons analysé le succès de reproduction en examinant les transitions entre les différents stades du cycle de reproduction pour trois carduelinés communs : la Linotte mélodieuse (Linaria cannabina), le Verdier d'Europe (Chloris chloris), et le Serin cini (Serinus serinus). Le succès de reproduction de ces oiseaux était faible (19 % des 88 nids pour L. cannabina, 16 % des 196 nids pour C. chloris, et 38 % des 234 nids pour S. serinus). De nombreux nids ont été abandonnés avant la ponte et l'échec de nidification était le plus élevé entre la ponte et l'éclosion. La prédation des nids (56,6 %) était la cause principale de perte de nids. Bien que les régimes de gestion des sols n'aient pas influé sur le succès de reproduction, la présence d'un couvert herbacé a eu des effets opposés sur la densité de nids des trois espèces : les bosquets avec couvert herbacé avaient une densité de nids plus élevée pour les verdiers, plus faible pour les serins, et ce couvert n'a eu aucun effet sur les linottes. D'autres facteurs, comme les perturbations dues aux activités de gestion ou les variations météorologiques interannuelles, peuvent avoir un impact plus important sur le succès de nidification que les régimes de gestion des sols, du moins pour certaines espèces et à des étapes spécifiques de leur cycle de reproduction. Le fait que la densité de nids de certains oiseaux ait été négativement affectée par le traitement des sols dicté par des actions agro-environnementales visant à favoriser la biodiversité soulève la question de l'applicabilité générale de ces mesures pour la conservation.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art10/ACE-ECO-2021-2038.pdf,ace-eco.org,pardo,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.1466577246915,"['serin', 'european serin', 'linaria cannabina', 'serinus serinus', 'european greenfinch', 'chloris chloris', 'ou', 'common linnet', 'verdier']",50

Acclimation to cold requires a range of physiological and morphological adjustments.

Phenotypic variation in thermogenic activity of the Red-billed Leiothrixs (Leiothrix lutea) was investigated under warm (35 °C), normal (25 °C) or cold (15 °C) ambient temperature conditions. Oxygen consumption was measured using an open-circuit respirometry system. Mitochondrial state-4 respiration and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity in liver, kidney heart and pectoral muscle were measured with a Clark electrode. Birds acclimated to an ambient temperature of 15 °C for 4 weeks significantly increased their basal metabolic rate (BMR) compared to a control group kept at 25 °C. Birds acclimated to 35 °C decreased their BMR, gross energy intake (GEI) and digestible energy intake (DEI). Furthermore, birds acclimated to 15 °C increased state-4 respiration in their pectoral muscles and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity in their liver and pectoral muscle, compared to the 25 °C control group. Birds acclimated to 35 °C also displayed lower state-4 respiration and COX activity in the liver, heart and pectoral muscles, compared to those kept at 25 °C. There was a positive correlation between BMR and state-4 respiration, and between BMR and COX activity, in all of the above organs except the liver and heart. Our study illustrates that the morphological, physiological, and enzymatic changes are associated with temperature acclimation in the Red-billed Leiothrix, and supports the notion that the primary means by which small birds meet the energetic challenges of cold conditions is through metabolic adjustments.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-019-0184-3,avianres.biomedcentral.com,junco,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.1526260933309,['leiothrix lutea'],862

We conducted playback-response experiments to assess whether the Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) population found on Grand Bahama Island might be a distinct and critically endangered species. In one experiment, Brown-headed Nuthatch individuals in north Florida were presented with calls from: (1) a male conspecific in North Carolina; (2) a male recorded on Grand Bahama Island; (3) a male Pygmy Nuthatch (S. pygmae), a western congener; and (4) a male House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), which occurs in a different avian family (Troglodytidae). Vocalizations were broadcast at 20 locations, and detection and the proximity with which individuals approached the speaker were quantified. Nuthatches were detected at 0.72 (± 0.02; mean ± standard deviation) of trials where conspecific vocalizations were used, but were only detected half as frequently 0.27–0.30 (± 0.04) when Bahama Nuthatch and Pygmy Nuthatch vocalizations were used. Detections were least likely when House Wren vocalizations were used (0.15 ± 0.11). Nuthatches also approached the playback device more closely when North Carolina vocalizations were used. In a second playback assessment conducted in the Bahamas, males were three times more likely to respond when calls of a Bahama male were used versus calls of males in Florida. We also analyzed spectrograms of the two-syllable call notes produced by Bahama (N= 1) and continental (N= 10) males. The Bahama call has a higher peak frequency (6.1 vs. 4.8 kHz ± 0.6) and a slurred descent that extends over a broader frequency range (4.5 vs. 2.0 kHz). Results suggest that vocalizations of the Bahama population have diverged significantly and may affect interactions if the populations were to come into contact. Other genetic and morphological assessments also point to significant differences and support recognition of the Bahama Nuthatch as an independent species that may now be extinct.
RÉSUMÉ
Nous avons mené des expériences de réponses à des enregistrements de chant pour évaluer si la population de Sittelles à tête brune (Sitta pusilla) présente sur l'île de Grand Bahama pourrait être une espèce distincte et en voie de disparition critique. Comme première expérience, nous avons fait jouer les enregistrements suivants à des individus de Sittelle à tête brune du nord de la Floride : (1) un mâle conspécifique de Caroline du Nord; (2) un mâle enregistré sur l'île de Grand Bahama; (3) une Sittelle pygmée mâle (S. pygmae), un congénère occidental; et (4) un Troglodyte familier mâle (Troglodytes aedon), qui fait partie d'une famille aviaire différente (Troglodytidae). Les enregistrements ont été diffusés à 20 sites, et la détection et la proximité avec laquelle les individus se sont approchés du haut-parleur ont été quantifiées. Les sittelles ont été détectées dans une proportion de 0,72 (± 0,02; moyenne ± écart type) lors d'essais où des enregistrements de conspécifiques ont été utilisés, mais ont été détectées deux fois moins souvent, soit 0,27-0,30 (± 0,04) lorsque des enregistrements de sittelle des Bahamas et de Sittelle pygmée ont été utilisés. La proportion de détections était plus faible lorsque des enregistrements de troglodytes étaient utilisés (0,15 ± 0,11). Les sittelles se sont également rapprochées davantage du haut-parleur lorsque des enregistrements de Caroline du Nord étaient utilisés. Lors d'une deuxième expérience effectuée aux Bahamas, les mâles ont été trois fois plus susceptibles de répondre aux enregistrements d'un mâle des Bahamas qu'à ceux d'un mâle de Floride. Nous avons aussi analysé les spectrogrammes des cris de deux syllabes produits par les mâles des Bahamas (N = 1) et du continent (N = 10). Le cri des Bahamas a une fréquence de crête plus élevée (6,1 vs. 4,8 kHz ± 0,6) et une descente qui s'étend sur une gamme de fréquences plus large (4,5 vs. 2,0 kHz). Nos résultats laissent entendre que les vocalisations de la population des Bahamas ont divergé de manière importante et pourraient affecter les interactions si les populations entraient en contact.

We conducted playback-response experiments to assess whether the Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) population found on Grand Bahama Island might be a distinct and critically endangered species. In one experiment, Brown-headed Nuthatch individuals in north Florida were presented with calls from: (1) a male conspecific in North Carolina; (2) a male recorded on Grand Bahama Island; (3) a male Pygmy Nuthatch (S. pygmae), a western congener; and (4) a male House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), which occurs in a different avian family (Troglodytidae). Vocalizations were broadcast at 20 locations, and detection and the proximity with which individuals approached the speaker were quantified. Nuthatches were detected at 0.72 (± 0.02; mean ± standard deviation) of trials where conspecific vocalizations were used, but were only detected half as frequently 0.27–0.30 (± 0.04) when Bahama Nuthatch and Pygmy Nuthatch vocalizations were used. Detections were least likely when House Wren vocalizations were used (0.15 ± 0.11). Nuthatches also approached the playback device more closely when North Carolina vocalizations were used. In a second playback assessment conducted in the Bahamas, males were three times more likely to respond when calls of a Bahama male were used versus calls of males in Florida. We also analyzed spectrograms of the two-syllable call notes produced by Bahama (N= 1) and continental (N= 10) males. The Bahama call has a higher peak frequency (6.1 vs. 4.8 kHz ± 0.6) and a slurred descent that extends over a broader frequency range (4.5 vs. 2.0 kHz). Results suggest that vocalizations of the Bahama population have diverged significantly and may affect interactions if the populations were to come into contact. Other genetic and morphological assessments also point to significant differences and support recognition of the Bahama Nuthatch as an independent species that may now be extinct.
RÉSUMÉ
Nous avons mené des expériences de réponses à des enregistrements de chant pour évaluer si la population de Sittelles à tête brune (Sitta pusilla) présente sur l'île de Grand Bahama pourrait être une espèce distincte et en voie de disparition critique. Comme première expérience, nous avons fait jouer les enregistrements suivants à des individus de Sittelle à tête brune du nord de la Floride : (1) un mâle conspécifique de Caroline du Nord; (2) un mâle enregistré sur l'île de Grand Bahama; (3) une Sittelle pygmée mâle (S. pygmae), un congénère occidental; et (4) un Troglodyte familier mâle (Troglodytes aedon), qui fait partie d'une famille aviaire différente (Troglodytidae). Les enregistrements ont été diffusés à 20 sites, et la détection et la proximité avec laquelle les individus se sont approchés du haut-parleur ont été quantifiées. Les sittelles ont été détectées dans une proportion de 0,72 (± 0,02; moyenne ± écart type) lors d'essais où des enregistrements de conspécifiques ont été utilisés, mais ont été détectées deux fois moins souvent, soit 0,27-0,30 (± 0,04) lorsque des enregistrements de sittelle des Bahamas et de Sittelle pygmée ont été utilisés. La proportion de détections était plus faible lorsque des enregistrements de troglodytes étaient utilisés (0,15 ± 0,11). Les sittelles se sont également rapprochées davantage du haut-parleur lorsque des enregistrements de Caroline du Nord étaient utilisés. Lors d'une deuxième expérience effectuée aux Bahamas, les mâles ont été trois fois plus susceptibles de répondre aux enregistrements d'un mâle des Bahamas qu'à ceux d'un mâle de Floride. Nous avons aussi analysé les spectrogrammes des cris de deux syllabes produits par les mâles des Bahamas (N = 1) et du continent (N = 10). Le cri des Bahamas a une fréquence de crête plus élevée (6,1 vs. 4,8 kHz ± 0,6) et une descente qui s'étend sur une gamme de fréquences plus large (4,5 vs. 2,0 kHz). Nos résultats laissent entendre que les vocalisations de la population des Bahamas ont divergé de manière importante et pourraient affecter les interactions si les populations entraient en contact.

2021-05-01,https://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art16/,Avian Conservation and Ecology: Cross-scale habitat ...,The Golden-winged Warbler is a neotropical migratory passerine that breeds throughout forests of the Appalachians and portions of the western Great Lakes region in North America (Confer et al. 2011). The species builds ground nests in early-successional forest stands or shrub wetlands (McNeil et al. 2014).,en,Cross-scale habitat selection reveals within-stand structural requirements for fledgling Golden-winged Warblers,"ABSTRACT
The post-fledging period remains one of the most understudied portions of the avian lifecycle despite the fact that fledglings require resources distinct from those used during nesting. Post-fledging research can further inform breeding grounds management actions and improve conservation outcomes. While the Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is known to make stand-level habitat shifts between nesting and post-fledging, the microhabitat conditions selected by fledglings remains unknown. We used cross-scale habitat selection analyses to evaluate the stand-specific microhabitat conditions required by fledgling Golden-winged Warblers in Pennsylvania. From 2014 through 2017 we radio-tagged and tracked 98 fledglings associated with 80 different sub-broods. We documented habitat use and compared habitat between fledgling and nest sites. Fledglings selected areas with dense overhead and lateral vegetation across stand types. Rubus cover and stem density of >2 m saplings were important in stand initiation and stem-exclusion stage stands, respectively. In mature forest upland and forested wetlands, fledgling Golden-winged Warblers selected for patches with lower basal area relative to what was available. Compared to nest sites fledgling locations contained less herbaceous cover and greater overhead vegetation density apparently provided by taller woody vegetation. Our findings suggest that management actions have high potential for creating post-fledging Golden-winged Warbler habitat, especially if factors such as invasive species and over-browsing are controlled during the regeneration stage of stands. Managers may need to take a proactive approach to create the structure required by fledglings in mature forest stand types where largely intact canopies inhibit understory regeneration. Existing management guidelines for the species should be updated to account for the unique vegetation structure required by fledglings during this stage of the lifecycle.
RÉSUMÉ
La période qui suit l'envol des jeunes reste l'un des stades les moins étudiés du cycle de vie des oiseaux, malgré le fait que les jeunes ont besoin de ressources différentes de celles utilisées pendant la nidification. La recherche ciblant la période après l'envol des jeunes peut éclairer davantage les activités d'aménagement des lieux de nidification et améliorer les résultats de conservation. Bien que l'on sache que la Paruline à ailes dorées (Vermivora chrysoptera) change de type de peuplements entre la nidification et l'envol, les attributs de microhabitat sélectionnés par les jeunes restent inconnus. Au moyen d'analyses de sélection d'habitat à différentes échelles, nous avons déterminé les attributs de microhabitat spécifiques au peuplement requis par les Parulines à ailes dorées ayant atteint l'âge d'envol en Pennsylvanie. De 2014 à 2017, nous avons marqué à l'aide de radios et suivi 98 jeunes associés à 80 nichées différentes. Nous avons documenté l'utilisation de l'habitat et comparé l'habitat entre les sites utilisés par les jeunes ayant pris leur envol et les sites de nidification. Les jeunes ont choisi des secteurs avec une végétation supérieure et latérale denses dans tous les types de peuplements. La couverture de Rubus et la densité de tiges de gaules de >2 m étaient importantes dans les peuplements en phase d'établissement et ceux en phase d'exclusion des arbres, respectivement. Dans les forêts matures poussant en terrain sec et les milieux humides boisés, les jeunes parulines ont choisi des îlots à surface basale plus faible par rapport à ce qui était disponible. Comparativement aux sites de nidification, les sites utilisés par les jeunes comportaient une couverture herbacée plus faible et une densité de végétation supérieure plus grande, apparemment attribuable à une végétation ligneuse plus haute. Nos résultats indiquent que les activités d'aménagement ont un fort potentiel pour créer de l'habitat pour les jeunes Parulines à ailes dorées après leur envol, en particulier si des facteurs tels que les espèces invasives et le broutage excessif sont contrôlés pendant la phase de régénération des peuplements. Les gestionnaires devront peut-être adopter une approche proactive pour créer la structure nécessaire aux jeunes dans les types de peuplements forestiers matures où la voûte largement intacte empêche la régénération du sous-étage. Les directives d'aménagement existantes pour l'espèce devraient être mises à jour pour tenir compte de la structure végétale unique requise par les jeunes durant ce stade de leur cycle de vie.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art16/ACE-ECO-2021-1807.pdf,ace-eco.org,scrub-warbler,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.162506132138,['vermivora chrysoptera'],354

(Ranunculaceae), a species with non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy","Aims Seed dormancy and the formation of a soil seed bank is important plant regeneration strategies, especially if the environment is unpredictable. The present research explores how environmental factors control seed dormancy release, and how seed dormancy is related to the soil seed bank and regeneration of the perennial Aquilegia oxysepala. Methods The effects of incubation temperature, light, cold and warm stratification, gibberellic acid (GA3) along with the germination phenology of A. oxysepala in the field were used to determine the type of seed dormancy. Seasonal change of seed dormancy was determined by regularly exhuming buried seeds and incubating them in laboratory conditions. Results A. oxysepala seeds has underdeveloped (small) embryos along with physiological dormancy at dispersal. With the increased amounts of cold stratification, the germination of A. oxysepala increased gradually. GA3 served as a substitute for cold stratification. Breaking of physiological dormancy under natural temperatures in the field occurred in winter, while growth of embryos and germination of seeds occurred in early spring. Viable seeds that had not germinated in early spring were induced into secondary dormancy by high soil temperatures. Conclusions A. oxysepala provides one of a few examples of dormancy cycling in seeds with morphophysiological dormancy. Freshly matured seeds of A. oxysepala seeds have non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy. The annual dormancy–non-dormancy cycle maintains the coordination between timing of seedling emergence with favorable seasons, thus increasing the survival chances of seedlings in environments with seasonal changes.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11104-021-04951-8.pdf,link.springer.com,épiscopale,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-10.1630427881318,,369

Temperate grassland biomes are globally imperiled, and grassland birds are in precipitous decline as a result. The majority of North America's grassland birds breed on rangelands occupied by domestic cattle, but reintroductions of bison to restore evolutionary grazing patterns are increasingly common. Grassland landscapes in western North America have undergone drastic changes since millions of bison occupied this landscape, and the biodiversity effects of bison on modern rangelands remain poorly understood. Here, we test the biodiversity effects of native versus non-native grazers in the context of a highly diverse grassland bird community on the Northern Great Plains of North America. We compared the effects of 2 different grazing treatments common across the region on avian diversity: seasonally grazed and manually rotated domestic cattle, and year-round, free-moving bison. We also test whether estimated abundances of 11 grassland/steppe obligate songbirds differ between these two management regimes. We found roughly equivalent bird diversity, as measured by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, at sites occupied year-round by bison and seasonally by cattle. We also found no significant effect of grazer type on 9 of 11 grassland songbird species. The two exceptions were Grasshopper Sparrow and Vesper Sparrow, which were more abundant in bison pastures. Our results suggest that both native and non-native grazers can create habitat for a highly diverse assemblage of grassland birds under grazer-specific management regimes.

Ornamental coloration in birds has been identified as a powerful, noninvasive tool for identifying exposure to metal pollution. Despite this potential, few studies have examined the effects of metals on iridescent coloration or assessed related impacts on bird fitness. Iridescent coloration is likely to be sensitive to metal pollution because it is already known to affect melanin production and this form of coloration is produced when light is refracted through layers of keratin and melanin inside feather barbules. In this study, we measured variation in plumage coloration, health (via oxidative stress), and reproductive success (via number of young fledged) of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) nesting adjacent to water bodies containing different levels of metal pollution. Plumage hue shifted from bluer to greener and feather brightness was greater, where concentrations of copper and zinc were higher. Both patterns would be expected from changes in the microstructure of the feathers. Unexpectedly, increasing exposure to these metals correlated with increased apparent health (lower oxidative stress) in female swallows, but not males. Number of young fledged decreased slightly with exposure to metals but did not vary with the color of parents. Our results suggest the relationships between ornamental color, including iridescence, and fitness metrics are complex and much more work will be needed before color of iridescent feathers can provide a proactive, noninvasive, and effective diagnostic tool for detecting subtle effects of pollution on birds.

The Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi) and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) are threatened landbirds in Canada and parts of the U.S. Both species are subjects of recent conservation and management interest. Protected areas are a key tool for managing populations of species at risk, and Canadian national parks may serve as important refuges in an increasingly fragmented landscape.

We used the Boreal Avian Modelling Project point count database to build Poisson log-linear models using forward stepwise variable selection to predict population density and distribution of these two threatened species in four national parks in Maritime Canada. We also predicted population density in areas of equivalent size in the same ecoregions outside the parks for comparison. Because forested wetlands, a key habitat for these species in this region, are difficult to represent with available spatial data, we tested the effectiveness of different remote sensing products. We tested GIS layers based on aerial photography wetlands (WETLANDS), depth to water table (WETNESS), and WETNESS as interacted with forest cover from aerial photography (WETxFOR). The best-performing models for the Olive-sided Flycatcher used WETxFOR, whereas WETNESS performed best for the Canada Warbler. Anthropogenic disturbance and proximity to roads had a negative effect on predicted density for both species. Protected areas showed slightly higher Olive-sided Flycatcher population densities than nearby areas, but not so for the Canada Warbler. Our results provide the first population density and population size estimates for these species in these parks, and novel information on the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on predicted population density.

Annual population growth in songbirds can be particularly sensitive to post-fledging survival, but research and management are frequently biased toward the nesting stage. Post-fledging information is particularly scarce for species breeding in desert bird communities, many of which have collapsed in recent decades. During 2017–2019 at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA, we used radio telemetry to monitor survival, movements, and habitat associations of 90 fledgling Gray Vireos (Vireo vicinior), a desert-dwelling species of conservation concern. We used logistic exposure models to investigate the relationship between fledgling survival and habitat features at two spatial scales. Overall, we estimated that 51 ± 8% of fledglings survived the monitoring period. All mortalities occurred during the first 12 days post-fledging and were attributed to predation and environmental exposure. In daily survival models focused on predation mortalities, age was the strongest predictor of survival. Daily survival rate was not related to any habitat variables we measured. Percent tree cover used by birds during the first 12 days post-fledging was similar to that of nesting sites and greater than that of random locations. Similarly, fledglings occupied individual trees and shrubs with lateral vegetation cover similar to that of nest locations. Minimum daily distance traveled, distance from nests, and variance associated with these measures, all increased with age. Except for the use of a larger area, habitats used by Gray Vireos during the post-fledging period were similar to those used for nesting in our study population, indicating that maintenance of large patches of moderately dense juniper is desirable for this species. More study is needed from populations in less pristine and more heterogeneous landscapes. More broadly, given the importance of first-year survival in demographic models and the declines of dryland birds, information is needed on the post-fledging period of many desert songbirds.
RESUME_
La croissance annuelle des populations de passereaux peut être particulièrement sensible à la survie après l'envol, mais la recherche et la gestion sont souvent orientées vers le stade de la nidification. Les données suivant l'envol sont particulièrement rares pour les espèces nichant au sein de communautés d'oiseaux de désert, dont beaucoup se sont effondrées au cours des dernières décennies. En 2017-2019, au Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge au Nouveau-Mexique (États-Unis), nous avons utilisé la radiotélémétrie pour suivre la survie, les déplacements et les associations avec l'habitat de 90 Viréos gris (Vireo vicinior) prêts à l'envol, une espèce désertique dont la conservation est préoccupante. Nous avons utilisé des modèles logistiques d'exposition pour étudier la relation entre la survie des oisillons et les caractéristiques de l'habitat à deux échelles spatiales. Dans l'ensemble, nous avons calculé que 51 ± 8 % des oisillons ont survécu durant la période suivie. Toutes les mortalités sont advenues au cours des 12 premiers jours après l'envol et ont été imputées à la prédation et à l'exposition à l'environnement. Dans les modèles de survie quotidienne axés sur les mortalités imputables à la prédation, l'âge était le facteur prédictif de la survie le plus fort. Le taux de survie quotidien n'était lié à aucune des variables de l'habitat que nous avons mesurées. Le couvert forestier utilisé par les oiseaux pendant les 12 premiers jours suivant l'envol avait un pourcentage similaire à celui des sites de nidification, mais était supérieur à celui de sites choisis aléatoirement. De même, les oisillons ont utilisé des arbres et des arbustes ayant une couverture végétale latérale similaire à celle des sites de nidification. La distance quotidienne minimale parcourue, la distance par rapport aux nids et la variance associée à ces mesures ont toutes augmenté avec l'âge. À l'exception de l'utilisation d'une plus grande aire, les Viréos gris ayant récemment pris leur envol ont utilisé des milieux qui étaient semblables à ceux utilisés pour la nidification dans la population à l'étude, ce qui indique que le maintien de grandes parcelles de genévriers modérément denses est souhaitable pour cette espèce. D'autres études sont nécessaires et devraient cibler des populations vivant dans des paysages moins vierges et plus hétérogènes. De façon générale, étant donné l'importance de la survie au cours de la première année dans les modèles démographiques et le déclin des oiseaux de zones sèches, les futures recherches devraient se concentrer sur la période suivant l'envol de nombreux passereaux de désert.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art13/ACE-ECO-2021-2053.pdf,ace-eco.org,vireo,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.1913691635709,['vireo vicinior'],50

Other Gruoidea have an even scarcer fossil record. Psophiidae and Aramidae are virtually unknown as fossils, and other fossil representatives of the Gruoidea are difficult to place. Here, we describe a new fossil that sheds new light on the early history of stem Gruidae, a right coracoid in dorsal view preserved on slab in limestone laminites of the early Oligocene « Calcaires de Campagne-Calavon» (Alpes de Haute Provence, France). It is compared with extant and fossil morphologically related taxa, and appears to differ from all extant and fossil relatives in the Gruoidea. The new fossil represents, among the Gruoidea, a new genus and species, Palaeogeranos tourmenti, placed within the clade (Aramidae + Gruidae) that is referred to as epifamily Gruoidae. Within Gruoidae, placement is tentative and we give arguments leading to propose a possible position as a stem Gruidae, a hypothesis to be tested with further discoveries. In this hypothesis, aged around 30 million years, the new fossil suggests that the stem of the Gruidae would date back to at least the earliest Oligocene, which is still compatible with current molecular phylogenetic divergence dates estimations, given the confidence intervals. Palaeogeranos will potentially help refining future calibrations for molecular phylogenetic studies, at least concerning the earliest Gruoidae (Aramidae + Gruidae).",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01891-z.pdf,link.springer.com,vigors,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-10.1952980605364,['limpkin'],354

Management of heather moorland for driven Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica) shooting in the British uplands may benefit some raptors by reducing predation risk, especially when breeding, and by increasing food availability. We describe changes in abundance and breeding success of four raptor species and Common Raven (Corvus corax) during a 27-year study on a grouse moor in southwest Scotland in relation to whether or not the moor was managed by gamekeepers. Ground-nesting raptors, Hen Harrier (Circus cyaneus) and Merlin (Falco columbarius), increased during periods of grouse moor management and had a higher proportion of successful nesting attempts. Predation was the main apparent cause of breeding failure. In contrast, grouse moor management did not influence either abundance or breeding success of tree- and crag-nesting species, i.e., Peregrine (Falco peregrinus), Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), and Raven. Buzzard sightings increased during the study, in line with their national recovery, whereas Peregrine and Raven showed little change in abundance. The results of our study highlight that management for Red Grouse can benefit both Hen Harrier and Merlin. However, on a UK scale these benefits to Hen Harriers, but not Merlin, are outweighed by their illegal killing, caused by fears that their consumption of Red Grouse can undermine the economics of grouse moor management.

This novel Borrelia species is common in two tick species, Amblyomma longirostre and A. geayi, which feed on a broad variety of neotropical mammal and bird species, including migratory species moving to North America. The novel Borrelia species is divergent from the LD and RF species, and is more closely related to the reptile- and echidna-associated Borrelia group that was recently described. Genome sequencing showed that this novel Borrelia sp. has a relatively small genome consisting of a 0.9-Mb-large chromosome and an additional 0.3 Mb dispersed on plasmids. It harbors an RF-like genomic organization but with a unique mixture of LD- and RF-specific genes, including genes used by RF Borrelia for the multiphasic antigen-switching system and a number of immune-reactive protein genes used for the diagnosis of LD. Overall, our data indicate that this novel Borrelia is an intermediate taxon between the LD and RF species that may impact a large host spectrum, including American mammals.

Here we present the sequences for the mitochondrial genomes of four additional thrips species, adding three extra families and an additional subfamily, thus greatly improving taxonomic coverage. Thrips mitochondrial genomes are marked by high rates of gene rearrangement, duplications of the control region and tRNA mutations. Derived features of mitochondrial tRNAs in thrips include gene duplications, anticodon mutations, loss of secondary structures and high gene translocation rates. Duplicated control regions are found in the Aeolothripidae and the ‘core’ Thripinae clade but do not appear to promote gene rearrangement as previously proposed. Phylogenetic analysis of thrips mitochondrial sequence data supports the monophyly of two suborders, a sister-group relationship between Stenurothripidae and Thripidae, and suggests a novel set of relationships between thripid genera. Ancestral state reconstructions indicate that genome rearrangements are common, with just eight gene blocks conserved between any thrips species and the ancestral insect mitochondrial genome. Conversely, 71 derived rearrangements are shared between at least two species, and 24 of these are unambiguous synapomorphies for clades identified by phylogenetic analysis. While the reconstructed sequence of genome rearrangements among the protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes could be inferred across the phylogeny, direct inference of phylogeny from rearrangement data in MLGO resulted in a highly discordant set of relationships inconsistent with both sequence-based phylogenies and previous morphological analysis. Given the demonstrated rates of genomic evolution within thrips, extensive sampling is needed to fully understand these phenomena across the order.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57705-4.pdf,nature.com,screamer,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2291946983602,,821

We investigate this possibility in two hybridizing species of warblers, Setophaga occidentalis and S. townsendi, in western North America. Inland S. townsendi harbor distinct mitochondrial DNA haplotypes from those of S. occidentalis. These populations also differ in several nuclear DNA regions. Coastal S. townsendi demonstrate mixed mitonuclear ancestry from S. occidentalis and inland S. townsendi. Of the few highly-differentiated chromosomal regions between inland S. townsendi and S. occidentalis, a 1.2 Mb gene block on chromosome 5 is also differentiated between coastal and inland S. townsendi. Genes in this block are associated with fatty acid oxidation and energy-related signaling transduction, thus linked to mitochondrial functions. Genetic variation within this candidate gene block covaries with mitochondrial DNA and shows signatures of divergent selection. Spatial variation in mitonuclear ancestries is correlated with climatic conditions. Together, these observations suggest divergent mitonuclear coadaptation underpins cryptic differentiation in this species complex. Little is known on how mitonuclear interactions influence genomic divergence among hybrid and parental lineages.

Over the past 40 years, grassland birds have declined steeply in North America, necessitating the study of limiting factors throughout their full annual cycle to mitigate this decline. Here we explored factors that may influence winter survival of two grassland specialist birds with steep declines; Baird's Sparrow (Centronyx bairdii) and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum). We studied the relationship of broad-scale ambient temperature and vegetation structure with winter survival of these species and explored the role of vegetation structure in providing microclimatic refuges for these overwintering sparrows. During three winters from 2016-2019, we monitored these species in the Marfa grasslands, Texas, using radio-telemetry. We placed radio-transmitters on >200 individuals of both species combined, and tracked them daily from mid-December to mid-March. We estimated ground cover in a 5 m radius circular plot for ≥ 20 locations per individual. We also placed temperature loggers at 40 bird points (of both species combined) and 40 random points to measure microclimate used by these birds. We then estimated winter survival probability using logistic-exposure and used general linear models to evaluate the relationship of ambient temperature and habitat covariates with survival. Winter survival over an 85 day period was lower for Grasshopper Sparrow than Baird's Sparrow (three-year mean = 65.92% and 85.54%, respectively), and ranged from 47% to 100% for both species. We found that minimum ambient temperature was the main factor limiting survival of sparrows. Microclimate temperatures were higher in bird locations compared to random locations and were warmer in shrub cover and tall grass than short grass or litter. These results indicate that microclimate may be important to sparrows on the wintering grounds and highlight the value of habitat structure for providing thermal refuges. Our results emphasize the need to maintain vegetative cover for grassland birds to protect against harsh weather conditions that may limit their survival.
RÉSUMÉ
Au cours des 40 dernières années, les oiseaux de prairies ont connu une forte diminution en Amérique du Nord, justifiant l'étude des facteurs limitants tout au long de leur cycle annuel afin d'atténuer cette baisse. Dans le présent article, nous avons exploré les facteurs qui peuvent influer sur la survie hivernale de deux oiseaux spécialistes de prairie dont la baisse est très marquée : le Bruant de Baird (Centronyx bairdii) et le Bruant sauterelle (Ammodramus savannarum). Nous avons étudié la relation entre la température ambiante à grande échelle et la structure de la végétation avec la survie hivernale de ces espèces et avons examiné le rôle de la structure de la végétation à fournir des refuges microclimatiques pour ces bruants hivernant. Pendant trois hivers de 2016 à 2019, nous avons suivi ces espèces dans les prairies de Marfa, au Texas, au moyen de la radiotélémétrie. Nous avons posé des radio-émetteurs sur > 200 individus des deux espèces, et les avons suivis quotidiennement de la mi-décembre à la mi-mars. Nous avons déterminé la couverture du sol dans un rayon de 5 m de rayon pour ≥ 20 sites par individu. Nous avons également installé des enregistreurs de température à 40 points d'oiseaux (des deux espèces combinées) et à 40 points aléatoires pour mesurer le microclimat utilisé par ces bruants. Nous avons ensuite calculé la probabilité de survie hivernale en utilisant la méthode d'exposition-logistique et des modèles linéaires généralisés pour évaluer la relation de la température ambiante et des covariables de l'habitat avec la survie. La survie hivernale sur une période de 85 jours était plus faible chez le Bruant sauterelle que chez le Bruant de Baird (moyenne sur trois ans = 65.92% et 85.54%, respectivement), et variait de 47 à 100% pour les deux espèces. Nous avons constaté que la température ambiante minimale était le principal facteur limitant la survie des bruants. Les températures du microclimat étaient plus élevées dans les endroits où se trouvaient les oiseaux par rapport aux endroits aléatoires et étaient plus chaudes dans le couvert arbustif et les hautes herbes que dans les herbes courtes ou la litière. Ces résultats indiquent que le microclimat est sans doute important pour les bruants sur les sites d'hivernage et soulignent la valeur de la structure de l'habitat à fournir des refuges thermiques. Nos résultats font ressortir la nécessité de maintenir un couvert végétal pour les oiseaux de prairies afin de les protéger contre les conditions climatiques sévères qui peuvent limiter leur survie.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art1/ACE-ECO-2021-2010.pdf,ace-eco.org,d'amérique,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2742136844061,"['grasshopper sparrow', 'ammodramus savannarum', 'ou']",109

The types of chromatophores present in the avian iris are lacking from the integument of birds or mammals, but are remarkably similar to those found in the skin of ectothermic vertebrates. To investigate molecular mechanisms associated with eye coloration in birds, we took advantage of a Mendelian mutation found in domestic pigeons that alters the deposition of yellow pterin pigments in the iris. Using a combination of genome-wide association analysis and linkage information in pedigrees, we mapped variation in eye coloration in pigeons to a small genomic region of ~8.5kb. This interval contained a single gene, SLC2A11B, which has been previously implicated in skin pigmentation and chromatophore differentiation in fish. Loss of yellow pigmentation is likely caused by a point mutation that introduces a premature STOP codon and leads to lower expression of SLC2A11B through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. There were no substantial changes in overall gene expression profiles between both iris types as well as in genes directly associated with pterin metabolism and/or chromatophore differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that SLC2A11B is required for the expression of pterin-based pigmentation in the avian iris. They further highlight common molecular mechanisms underlying the production of coloration in the iris of birds and skin of ectothermic vertebrates.",https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009404&type=printable,journals.plos.org,iris,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2778592533347,,421

Background: Flying birds, especially those that hover, need to meet high energetic demands. Birds that meet this 
demand through nectarivory face the added challenges of maintaining homeostasis in the face of spikes in blood 
sugar associated with nectar meals, as well as transporting that sugar to energetically demanding tissues. Nectari-
vory has evolved many times in birds and we hypothesized that the challenges of this dietary strategy would exert 
selective pressure on key aspects of metabolic physiology. Specifically, we hypothesized we would find convergent or 
parallel amino acid substitutions among different nectarivorous lineages in a protein important to sensing, regulating, 
and transporting glucose, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2).
Methods: Genetic sequences for GLUT2 were obtained from ten pairs of nectarivorous and non-nectarivorous sister 
taxa. We performed PCR amplification of the intracellular C-terminal domain of GLUT2 and adjacent protein domains 
due to the role of this region in determination of transport rate, substrate specificity and glucosensing.
Results: Our findings have ruled out the C-terminal regulatory region of GLUT2 as a target for selection by sugar-rich 
diet among avian nectarivores, though selection among hummingbirds, the oldest avian nectarivores, cannot be 
discounted.
Conclusion: Our results indicate future studies should examine down-stream targets of GLUT2-mediated glucosens-
ing and insulin secretion, such as insulin receptors and their targets, as potential sites of selection by nectarivory in 
birds.

launch an ornithological journal dedicated to Neotropical
birds. The first issue of Ararajuba (ISSN 0103-5657), the
common name of the endemic golden parakeet (Guaruba
guarouba) showing the green and yellow colors of the
Brazilian flag, edited by Dr. Luiz P. Gonzaga, had the first
issue published in 1990. In its 124 pages, icons of the
Neotropical ornithology such as J. Vielliard, E.O. Willis, H.
Sick, and D.C. Oren authored 20 full papers and notes, which
included the description of the Cipó Canastero, Asthenes
luizae (Vielliard 1990). Up to 1995, and despite some tempo-
ral gaps, it was published as a single issue annually, predom-
inantly in Portuguese, but accepting manuscripts in English
and Spanish. In times of snail-mail communication among
authors, the editor, and reviewers, many of which in North
America and Europe, building a solid and regular journal
had been a remarkable feat. Since 1996, under the guidance
of Dr. Miguel Â. Marini as Editor-in-chief, Ararajuba started

Songbird communities that rely on sagebrush habitat for breeding are experiencing steep population declines, while a large amount of the sagebrush ecosystem continues to be impacted by energy development. Reclamation is increasingly emphasized as a means of mitigating impacts on species that have been affected by oil and gas development; however, the response of sagebrush species to reclamation has largely been untested. We used nest survival of the Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri breweri) as an indicator of fitness responses to short-term reclamation in sagebrush habitat. We assessed oil and gas reclamation ~5 years after reclamation, but sagebrush reestablishment is a slow process; thus, the legacy of these disturbances (i.e., disturbance scars) will likely remain for decades. We compared Brewer's Sparrow nest survival across a gradient of oil and gas development from undisturbed and active development to areas that had undergone oil and gas reclamation. Nest survival was assessed at multiple scales from microhabitat to landscape. The distribution of nest sites in the active and reclamation areas suggested local avoidance of disturbance, both active and reclamation disturbance, when establishing nesting territories. We found that reclamation benefited nest survival at a local-scale when disturbance exposure exceeded 15%. Our findings demonstrated scale-dependent nest survival relationships. Across microhabitat and landscape scales, sagebrush canopy cover and composition were important to Brewer's Sparrow nest survival. Combined, these finding emphasize the importance of avoiding the removal of sagebrush habitat whenever possible and expediting sagebrush reestablishment in reclamation areas to maintain high quality sagebrush habitat for breeding songbird populations.
RÉSUMÉ
Les communautés de passereaux qui dépendent des milieux d'armoises pour se reproduire connaissent une forte diminution de leurs populations, alors qu'une grande partie de l'écosystème à armoises continue d'être touchée par l'installation d'aménagements énergétiques. La remise en état est de plus en plus mise de l'avant comme moyen d'atténuer les impacts sur les espèces qui ont été affectées par l'installation de production pétrolière et gazière; cependant, la réponse des espèces nichant dans les milieux d'armoises à la remise en état n'a à peu près pas été testée. Nous avons utilisé la survie des nids du Bruant de Brewer (Spizella breweri breweri) comme indicateur du succès d'adaptation à la remise en état à court terme de milieux d'armoises. Nous avons évalué la restauration à des installations de production pétrolière et gazière environ 5 ans après la remise en état, mais le rétablissement de l'armoise est un processus lent; ainsi, les séquelles des perturbations (c'est-à-dire les « cicatrices » des perturbations) perdureront probablement pendant des décennies. Nous avons comparé la survie des nids de Bruant de Brewer sur un gradient d'installations de production pétrolière et gazière, allant de zones non perturbées et de construction active à des zones pétrolière et gazière ayant fait l'objet d'une remise en état. La survie des nids a été évaluée à plusieurs échelles, du microhabitat au paysage. La répartition des sites de nidification dans les zones actives et les zones remises en état indique que les oiseaux évitent localement les perturbations lors de l'établissement des territoires de nidification. Nous avons constaté que la remise en état favorisait la survie des nids à l'échelle locale lorsque l'exposition aux perturbations dépassait 15 %. Nos résultats ont montré que les relations de survie des nids dépendent de l'échelle. À l'échelle du microhabitat et du paysage, le couvert et la composition des milieux d'armoises étaient importants pour la survie des nids. Ensemble, ces résultats soulignent l'importance d'éviter, dans la mesure du possible, d'éliminer les milieux d'armoises et d'accélérer le rétablissement de l'armoise dans les zones de remise en état afin de maintenir un habitat d'armoises de haute qualité pour les populations de passereaux nicheurs.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art3/ACE-ECO-2021-1913.pdf,ace-eco.org,vigors,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2832955886522,['spizella breweri'],293

Anthropogenic climate change and habitat loss pose major threats to grassland breeding birds, the most rapidly declining group of birds in continental North America. Although previous studies have investigated grassland breeding bird responses to land management, few empirical studies explore their responses to climatic variation or its interactions with land management, which warrant urgent conservation attention. We evaluated the effects of climate and land management parameters on an indicator species for grassland breeding birds, the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), a Neotropical migrant of conservation concern whose global population has declined by more than two thirds since 1970. We quantified Grasshopper Sparrow responses to climate variation, land management actions, and their interactions in the Platte River Valley, Nebraska, in the North American Great Plains, using six years of mark-recapture data collected via the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. We implemented generalized linear mixed models to estimate avian population trends (adult abundance and productivity) in response to changes in precipitation and temperature as well as cattle grazing, haying, and prescribed burning. Our models showed that climatic variation, especially spring precipitation, was the most important driver of avian population trends. Grasshopper Sparrow abundance declined with increasing spring precipitation, but prescribed burns helped mitigate this effect and were positively related to productivity, especially during years of lower spring temperatures. Our findings demonstrate the vulnerability of grassland bird population trends to ongoing and predicted climate change as well as the potential of land management actions to mitigate some negative effects of climate change on grassland breeding birds.
RÉSUMÉ
Les changements climatiques d'origine anthropique et la perte d'habitat constituent des menaces majeures pour les oiseaux de prairie nicheurs, groupe d'espèces qui diminue le plus rapidement en Amérique du Nord continentale. Bien que des études antérieures aient examiné les réactions des oiseaux de prairie nicheurs suivant la gestion des terres, peu d'études empiriques ont exploré leurs comportements à la suite de variations climatiques ou leurs interactions avec l'aménagement des terres, qui méritent pourtant une attention urgente pour la conservation. Nous avons évalué les effets du climat et des paramètres de gestion des terres sur une espèce représentative des oiseaux de prairie nicheurs, le Bruant sauterelle (Ammodramus savannarum), un migrateur néotropical dont la population mondiale a diminué de plus des deux tiers depuis 1970. Nous avons quantifié les réactions des Bruants sauterelles aux variations climatiques, aux mesures de gestion des terres et à leurs interactions dans la vallée de la rivière Platte, au Nebraska, dans les Grandes Plaines d'Amérique du Nord, en utilisant six ans de données de marquage-recapture collectées au moyen du protocole MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship). Nous avons conçu des modèles linéaires généralisés à effets mixtes pour estimer la démographie (abondance des adultes et productivité, ou nombre de jeunes) en réponse aux changements de précipitation et de température ainsi qu'au pâturage du bétail, à la fenaison et au brûlage dirigé. Nos modèles montrent que la variation climatique, en particulier les précipitations printanières, était le facteur principal agissant sur les tendances démographiques. Le nombre de Bruants sauterelles a diminué avec l'augmentation des précipitations printanières, mais les brûlages dirigés ont aidé à atténuer cet effet et étaient positivement liés à la productivité, surtout lors des années de températures printanières plus basses. Selon nos résultats, les populations d'oiseaux de prairie sont vulnérables aux changements climatiques en cours et prévus, et des mesures de gestion des terres adéquates peuvent atténuer certains effets négatifs des changements climatiques sur les oiseaux de prairie nicheurs.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art4/ACE-ECO-2020-1515.pdf,ace-eco.org,sylvain,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2847396600185,"['grasshopper sparrow', 'ammodramus savannarum', 'ou']",809

Incorporating information about habitat use and success of breeding birds contributes to a more complete understanding of their ecology and distribution, and can also inform management strategies for species of conservation concern. We used occupancy data that accounted for imperfect detection from a two-year field study of two territorial waterbird species in southcentral Saskatchewan (n = 172 ponds on seven study sites) to explore correlates of pond use and breeding success. In Pied-billed (Podilymbus podiceps) and Horned (Podiceps auritus) Grebes, breeding habitat occupancy corresponded most closely to pond-specific factors rather than those operating at spatial scales beyond the local wetland basin. Pied-billed Grebes were more likely to occupy wetlands that were larger, had greater shoreline complexity, and had less cropland in the adjacent uplands whereas Horned Grebes were more likely to occupy wetlands with less emergent vegetation. These distinct microhabitat preferences could serve to limit interspecific competition. While there was no observable difference in pond occupancy rates between low and high wetland density landscapes, the latter areas contribute disproportionately more breeding habitat for grebes. Using naïve occupancy estimates, breeding success was similar for Horned (0.75, SE = 0.06) and Pied-billed (0.67, SE = 0.07) Grebes. Ongoing conservation initiatives that protect and restore wetland habitat in areas of the prairie and parkland ecoregions with high densities of semipermanent and permanent wetlands should improve long-term habitat security for breeding grebes, including Horned Grebes.
RÉSUMÉ
L'intégration des informations concernant l'utilisation de l'habitat et le succès de la reproduction des oiseaux permet de mieux comprendre leur écologie et leur répartition et peut aussi informer des stratégies de gestion des espèces dont la conservation est préoccupante. Nous avons utilisé des données d'occupation qui tenaient compte de la détection imparfaite à partir d'une étude de deux ans sur le terrain portant sur deux espèces d'oiseaux aquatiques territoriaux dans la partie centrale-sud du Saskatchewan (n = 172 mares sur sept sites étudiés) pour explorer les corrélations entre l'utilisation des mares et le succès de la reproduction. Chez les grèbes à bec bigarré (Podilymbus podiceps) et les grèbes esclavons (Podiceps auritus), l'occupation de l'habitat de reproduction correspondait au mieux à des facteurs spécifiques aux mares qu'à ceux qui opéraient sur des échelles spatiales au-delà du bassin local des zones humides. Les grèbes à bec bigarré étaient plus susceptibles d'occuper des zones humides, dont la côte présentait une plus grande complexité et où les hautes terres voisines étaient moins cultivées, alors que les grèbes esclavons étaient plus susceptibles d'occuper des zones humides présentant moins de végétation émergente. Ces préférences distinctes pour certains micro-habitats pourraient servir à limiter la concurrence interspécifique. Même si on n'a observé aucune différence notable en termes de taux d'occupation des mares entre les paysages à faible et haute densité de terres humides, ces derniers offrent énormément plus d'habitats de reproduction aux grèbes. En utilisant des estimations d'occupation naïves, le succès de la reproduction était similaire chez le grèbe à bec bigarré (0,75, SE = 0,06) et le grève esclavon (0,67, SE = 0,07). Les initiatives de conservation en cours qui protègent et restaurent l'habitat des zones humides dans les régions de la prairie et les écorégions des parcs à forte densité de zones humides semi-permanentes et permanentes devraient permettre d'améliorer la sécurité à long termes des habitats pour les grèbes reproducteurs, y compris les grèbes à bec bigarré.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss2/art3/ACE-ECO-2020-1641.pdf,ace-eco.org,belcher,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.2913439066228,"['podiceps auritus', 'podilymbus podiceps']",658

Many shorebirds (Order: Charadriiformes; Family: Charadriidae, Recurvirostridae, Scolopacidae, Haematopodidae, Jacanidae) are highly migratory, traversing thousands of kilometers between high latitude breeding and low latitude nonbreeding sites. In doing so, they are dependent on networks of coastal and interior wetland ecosystems. To aid in the effective conservation and management of their populations, and to assess the impact of threats facing shorebirds, standardized data on shorebird abundance are needed from multiple sites representing a gradient of conditions across the hemisphere. Such data would provide insight on whether fluctuations at one location represent real changes in abundance because of some localized threat, or whether other factors acting across broader scales such as the redistribution of predators, are responsible. We designed the Migratory Shorebird Project (MSP), now implemented in 11 countries along the Pacific Coast of the Americas, to characterize spatial and temporal variation in shorebird abundance, to understand which factors (habitat, threats) most influence their populations across the flyway, and to increase capacity for integrated research, monitoring, and conservation. We used bird inventory data from historical surveys and spatial data on habitat distribution along with a set of hypotheses about important threats to guide the design of the project and to identify data requirements to test hypotheses. We counted birds one time per year at 84 nonbreeding sites (~1400 sampling units) between 15 November and 15 February, when shorebirds were relatively stationary. In each of the first three annual counts from 2013/14 to 2015/16, the Migratory Shorebird Project counted ~1M shorebirds representing 44 species, including five species for which > 20% of the estimated biogeographic population was recorded annually, and nine additional species with > 5% recorded annually. The magnitude of variability in estimates of shorebird abundance was inversely correlated with survey effort with the most uncertainty, and lowest survey effort, in the South Temperate region followed by the Neotropical region (southern Mexico to northern Peru) and then the North Temperate region. Evaluation of variance highlighted both among-site and among-unit (“units” are nested within sites) variation in bird abundance and cover types as well as threats such as potential disturbance and predator abundance. Overall, shorebird density was significantly, and positively, associated with the area (ha) of intertidal mudflats, beaches, and aquaculture. Survey units with intermediate levels of bare ground and flooding had the highest shorebird density. As for threats, we found, contrary to our hypothesis, that shorebird abundance was significantly, and positively, associated, with the density of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus); however we found no relationship between shorebird abundance and the amount of urban development, our index to potential human disturbance, in the surrounding landscape. The Migratory Shorebird Project is providing an essential data foundation and network for increased knowledge of the factors affecting shorebirds across the Pacific Coast of the Americas and identifying what and where conservation actions could have the greatest impact.
RÉSUMÉ
De nombreux oiseaux de rivage (Ordre : Charadriiformes; Famille : Charadriidae, Recurvirostridae, Scolopacidae, Haematopodidae, Jacanidae) sont de grands migrateurs, parcourant des milliers de kilomètres entre les sites de reproduction à hautes latitudes et les sites hors reproduction à basses latitudes. Ce faisant, ils dépendent de réseaux d'écosystèmes de zones humides côtières et intérieures. Pour contribuer à la conservation et à la gestion efficaces de leurs populations, et évaluer l'impact des menaces qui pèsent sur eux, il est nécessaire de disposer de données normalisées sur leur abondance provenant de multiples sites représentant un gradient de conditions à travers l'hémisphère. Ces données permettraient de savoir si les fluctuations à un endroit donné représentent de réels changements dans l'abondance en raison d'une menace localisée ou si d'autres facteurs agissant à des échelles plus grandes, comme la redistribution des prédateurs, en sont responsables. Nous avons conçu le Projet sur les oiseaux de rivage migrateurs (Migratory Shorebird Project [MSP] en anglais), actuellement mis en oeuvre dans 11 pays de la côte pacifique des Amériques, afin de caractériser les variations spatiales et temporelles de l'abondance des oiseaux de rivage, de comprendre quels facteurs (habitats, menaces) influencent le plus leurs populations sur la voie de migration, et d'accroître la capacité de recherche intégrée, de surveillance et de conservation. Nous avons utilisé des données d'inventaire d'oiseaux provenant de relevés historiques et des données spatiales sur la répartition des habitats ainsi qu'un ensemble d'hypothèses sur les menaces importantes pour guider la conception du projet et identifier les besoins en données afin de tester les hypothèses. Nous avons dénombré les oiseaux une fois par an sur 84 sites hors reproduction (~1400 unités d'échantillonnage) entre le 15 novembre et le 15 février, lorsque les oiseaux de rivage étaient relativement stationnaires. À chacun des trois premiers comptages annuels de 2013-14 à 2015-16, le MSP a dénombré environ 1 million d'oiseaux de rivage représentant 44 espèces, dont cinq espèces pour lesquelles > 20 % de la population biogéographique estimée a été enregistrée chaque année, et neuf autres espèces pour lesquelles > 5 % a été enregistrée chaque année. L'ampleur de la variabilité des estimations de l'abondance des oiseaux de rivage était inversement corrélée à l'effort d'inventaire; la plus grande incertitude et l'effort d'inventaire le plus faible ont été observés dans la région tempérée du Sud, suivie de la région Néotropicale (du sud du Mexique au nord du Pérou), puis de la région tempérée du Nord. L'évaluation de la variance a mis en évidence la variation de l'abondance des oiseaux et des types de couverts, ainsi que les menaces telles que les perturbations potentielles et l'abondance des prédateurs, à la fois entre les sites et entre les unités (les « unités » sont situées dans les sites). Dans l'ensemble, la densité des oiseaux de rivage a été associée de manière significative et positive à la superficie (ha) des vasières intertidales, des plages et de l'aquaculture. Les unités d'inventaire présentant des niveaux intermédiaires de sol nu et d'inondation présentaient la plus forte densité d'oiseaux de rivage. En ce qui concerne les menaces, nous avons constaté, contrairement à notre hypothèse, que l'abondance des oiseaux de rivage était significativement et positivement associée à la densité de Faucons pèlerins (Falco peregrinus); cependant, nous n'avons trouvé aucune relation entre l'abondance des oiseaux de rivage et l'importance du développement urbain, notre indice de perturbation humaine potentielle, dans le paysage environnant.

Intra-species contests are common in the animal kingdom and can have fitness consequences. Most research on what predicts
contest outcome focuses on morphology, although differences in personality and cognition may also be involved. Supporting
this, more proactive individuals often have dominant status, although the causality of this relationship is rarely investigated.
Contest initiators often win; thus, individuals that are more proactive in their personality (e.g., more aggressive, risk-taking) or
cognition (e.g., more optimistic, impulsive) may initiate contests more often. To investigate this, we assayed the behavior and
cognition of sexually mature male and female red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), a species in which both sexes contest over social
status, before staging intra-sexual contests. We confirm that contest initiators were more likely to win. In males, individuals that
behaved more boldly in a novel arena test were more likely to initiate and win contests. Female initiators tended to be less active
in novel object test, more aggressive in a restrained opponent test, and respond less optimistically in a cognitive judgement bias
test, whereas the main predictor of whether a female would win a contest was whether she initiated it. These results suggest that
behaviors attributed to proactive and reactive personalities, and—at least for female red junglefowl—optimism, can affect contest
initiation and outcome. Therefore, within species, and depending on sex, different aspects of behavior and cognition may
independently affect contest initiation and outcome. The generality of these findings, and their fitness consequences, requires
further investigation.

Phenotypic plasticity may help organisms persist in modified habitats. Yet, its adaptive value is frequently ignored because fitness consequences are not explored at the required time scale. Taking advantage of a 16-yr nest-box supplementation program, we explored effects of nest type and two social-ecological indices (breeding cluster size and distances between clusters) on adult and offspring survival of a non-excavator cavity-nesting bird species, the European roller (Coracias garrulus), a species of conservation concern. We also investigated site and habitat fidelity associated with different nest types. Apparent survival of rollers was mainly explained by age and sex. Social-ecological factors were more important than cavity type in apparent survival. Increases in apparent survival with decreasing distance to neighboring clusters were comparable for adult males and females but were stronger for juvenile males than for juvenile females. Nest type influenced residency patterns, so that males breeding in nest-boxes were more likely to be recaptured in subsequent years at the study site and in the same nest type compared with males associated with natural and semi-natural nest types. Whereas phenotypic plasticity in nest selection might favor rapid colonization of a novel nest type, widespread use of nest-boxes can decrease, through their effects on site and habitat fidelity, a species’ responsiveness to environmental changes. We suggest that nest-box schemes should be applied to promote higher connectiveness of breeding populations and that nest-box programs may influence population dynamics and habitat selection criteria via their effect on social information and natal habitat preference induction.
RÉSUMÉ
La plasticité phénotypique pourrait aider les organismes à persister dans des habitats modifiés. Pourtant, sa valeur adaptative est fréquemment ignorée, car les conséquences en termes d'adéquation ne sont pas explorées sur l'échelle de temps requise. En nous appuyant sur un programme d'installation de nichoirs supplémentaires sur une période de 16 ans, nous avons examiné les effets des types de nichoirs et deux index socio-écologiques (taille des pôles de reproduction et distance entre les pôles) sur la survie des adultes et des petits d'une espèce d'oiseaux non-excavateurs nichant dans les cavités, le rollier d'Europe (Coracias garrulus), espèce dont la conservation est préoccupante. Nous avons aussi enquêté sur le site et la fidélité à l'habitat associés à différents types de nid. La survie apparente des rolliers s'expliquait principalement par l'âge et le sexe. Les facteurs socio-écologiques étaient plus importants que le type de cavité pour la survie apparente. L'augmentation de la survie apparente liée à la réduction de la distance par rapport aux pôles voisins était comparable chez les mâles et les femelles adultes, mais plus élevée chez les jeunes mâles que chez les jeunes femelles. Le type de nid influençait les modèles de résidence : ainsi, les mâles qui se reproduisaient dans des nichoirs étaient plus susceptibles d'être à nouveau capturés lors des années suivantes sur le site de l'étude et dans le même type de nid, par rapport aux mâles associés à des types de nid naturels et semi-naturels. Si la plasticité phénotypique dans la sélection du nid pourrait favoriser la colonisation rapide d'un nouveau type de nid, l'utilisation étendue des nichoirs risquerait de diminuer la réactivité d'une espèce aux changements d'environnement, de par ses effets sur la fidélité à un site et un habitat. Nous suggérons d'appliquer des programmes de nichoirs pour promouvoir une connectivité supérieure des populations reproductrices : en effet, les nichoirs pourraient influencer la dynamique des populations et les critères de sélection de l'habitat, de par leur effet sur les informations sociales et l'induction de préférences en termes d'habitat natal.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art8/ACE-ECO-2021-1928.pdf,ace-eco.org,trumpeter,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.305956781938,"[""rollier d'europe"", 'coracias garrulus', 'european roller']",262

Wetland loss is cause for concern for populations of many wetland bird species throughout North America. The North American Breeding Bird Survey, the primary resource for broad-scale avian population data, does not provide sufficient data for many marsh bird species. Targeted marsh bird monitoring programs have been implemented across the continent in an attempt to fill this gap. Despite these efforts, a number of wetland species are so elusive that they remain an analytical challenge because of small sample sizes and low detectability. Thus, there is need for tools and approaches that will increase sampling efficiency and boost geographic representation. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have the potential to address some of these challenges, but require the ability to combine in-person survey data with ARU data for collective analysis. Our primary objective was to estimate statistical offsets, or correction factors, to account for systematic differences between in-person and ARU counts of wetland-associated bird species. We found that ARU recordings were generally equivalent to in-person point counts, with bias in a small number of species (2 of 19 for Song MeterTMSM2 and 1 of 16 for Song MeterTMSM4 Acoustic Recorders; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). However, bias was removed in all of the species through use of our correction factors. Therefore, our correction factors were effective for integrating in-person and ARU point count data even for species where differences exist. We also found that commercially available SM4 recorders have larger effective detection radii than SM2 recorders. Researchers should consider the microphone sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios of any recording unit before purchasing, and more sensitive models with lower noise should be used where possible. Our results, and particularly our correction factors, are useful for biologists combining in-person and ARU point count data to achieve larger sample sizes, higher statistical power, and ultimately better information for more effective wetland conservation.
RÉSUMÉ
La disparition des zones humides est une cause de préoccupation pour nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux des zones humides à travers l'Amérique du Nord. La North American Breeding Bird Survey, principale source de données à grande échelle concernant les populations aviaires, s'avère toutefois insuffisante dans le cas de nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux des marais. Des programmes ciblés de surveillance des oiseaux des marais ont été mis en oeuvre sur l'ensemble du continent afin de combler cette lacune. En dépit de ces efforts, un certain nombre d'espèces d'oiseaux des marais sont si insaisissables qu'elles constituent un défi en termes d'analyse en raison de la petite taille des échantillons et de leur faible détectabilité. Il est donc nécessaire de trouver des outils et des approches qui augmenteront l'efficacité de l'échantillonnage et amélioreront la représentation géographique. Les unités d'enregistrement autonomes (ARU) pourraient permettre de relever certains de ces défis. Il faudrait toutefois être en mesure de combiner les données recueillies lors d'enquêtes en personne et les données ARU aux fins d'analyse collective. Notre objectif principal était d'estimer les décalages statistiques et d'appliquer des facteurs de correction afin de tenir compte de différences systématiques entre les comptages réalisés en personne et via des ARU sur les espèces d'oiseaux des zones humides. Nous avons constaté que les enregistrements des ARU étaient généralement équivalents aux comptages effectués en personne, avec un biais pour un petit nombre d'espèces (2 sur 19 avec les enregistreurs acoustiques Song MeterTM SM2 et 1 sur 16 avec les enregistreurs Song MeterTM SM4 ; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). Nos facteurs de correction ont cependant permis d'éliminer ce biais pour toutes les espèces. En conséquence, nos facteurs de correction se sont avérés efficaces pour intégrer les données de comptage en personne et via des ARU, même pour les espèces où il existe des différences. Nous avons également constaté que les enregistreurs SM4 vendus dans le commerce présentent des rayons de détection effectifs plus importants que les enregistreurs SM2.

Wetland loss is cause for concern for populations of many wetland bird species throughout North America. The North American Breeding Bird Survey, the primary resource for broad-scale avian population data, does not provide sufficient data for many marsh bird species. Targeted marsh bird monitoring programs have been implemented across the continent in an attempt to fill this gap. Despite these efforts, a number of wetland species are so elusive that they remain an analytical challenge because of small sample sizes and low detectability. Thus, there is need for tools and approaches that will increase sampling efficiency and boost geographic representation. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) have the potential to address some of these challenges, but require the ability to combine in-person survey data with ARU data for collective analysis. Our primary objective was to estimate statistical offsets, or correction factors, to account for systematic differences between in-person and ARU counts of wetland-associated bird species. We found that ARU recordings were generally equivalent to in-person point counts, with bias in a small number of species (2 of 19 for Song MeterTMSM2 and 1 of 16 for Song MeterTMSM4 Acoustic Recorders; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). However, bias was removed in all of the species through use of our correction factors. Therefore, our correction factors were effective for integrating in-person and ARU point count data even for species where differences exist. We also found that commercially available SM4 recorders have larger effective detection radii than SM2 recorders. Researchers should consider the microphone sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios of any recording unit before purchasing, and more sensitive models with lower noise should be used where possible. Our results, and particularly our correction factors, are useful for biologists combining in-person and ARU point count data to achieve larger sample sizes, higher statistical power, and ultimately better information for more effective wetland conservation.
RÉSUMÉ
La disparition des zones humides est une cause de préoccupation pour nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux des zones humides à travers l'Amérique du Nord. La North American Breeding Bird Survey, principale source de données à grande échelle concernant les populations aviaires, s'avère toutefois insuffisante dans le cas de nombreuses espèces d'oiseaux des marais. Des programmes ciblés de surveillance des oiseaux des marais ont été mis en oeuvre sur l'ensemble du continent afin de combler cette lacune. En dépit de ces efforts, un certain nombre d'espèces d'oiseaux des marais sont si insaisissables qu'elles constituent un défi en termes d'analyse en raison de la petite taille des échantillons et de leur faible détectabilité. Il est donc nécessaire de trouver des outils et des approches qui augmenteront l'efficacité de l'échantillonnage et amélioreront la représentation géographique. Les unités d'enregistrement autonomes (ARU) pourraient permettre de relever certains de ces défis. Il faudrait toutefois être en mesure de combiner les données recueillies lors d'enquêtes en personne et les données ARU aux fins d'analyse collective. Notre objectif principal était d'estimer les décalages statistiques et d'appliquer des facteurs de correction afin de tenir compte de différences systématiques entre les comptages réalisés en personne et via des ARU sur les espèces d'oiseaux des zones humides. Nous avons constaté que les enregistrements des ARU étaient généralement équivalents aux comptages effectués en personne, avec un biais pour un petit nombre d'espèces (2 sur 19 avec les enregistreurs acoustiques Song MeterTM SM2 et 1 sur 16 avec les enregistreurs Song MeterTM SM4 ; Wildlife Acoustics Inc. ©, Maynard, MA). Nos facteurs de correction ont cependant permis d'éliminer ce biais pour toutes les espèces. En conséquence, nos facteurs de correction se sont avérés efficaces pour intégrer les données de comptage en personne et via des ARU, même pour les espèces où il existe des différences. Nous avons également constaté que les enregistreurs SM4 vendus dans le commerce présentent des rayons de détection effectifs plus importants que les enregistreurs SM2.

Anthropogenic landscape modification which leads to the displacement of species, is arguably one of the most profound impacts on animal movement globally. In urban landscapes, animal movement is generally impacted by varying levels of increased urbanization. However, this is species dependent and is mostly guided by the surrounding habitat. Fragmentation and habitat patch isolation must be considered at scales appropriate to the study species. Using telemetry, we test these assumptions investigating movement patterns of flocks of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso; RTBC) between three regions: urban, peri-urban, and forest using GPS and satellite PTT. This species occurs at varying levels of urbanization, however, how this might affect its movements is largely unknown. We did not find evidence that RTBC movement was impaired in the urban region compared with peri-urban or forest regions. It found, however, a significant within-region variation in movement extent among flocks and across regions depending on foraging resource availability and location. Differences in daily movement distance (Av. 4.96 - 16.41 km) and home range size (6.02 - 52.57 km2) between urban flocks appeared to be associated with the proximity of green spaces as roosts and foraging sites, with roadside vegetation providing important foraging resources and movement corridors. Key urban habitats were predominantly located in public nature reserves and private properties, with roadside vegetation connecting these sites for RTBC. The findings of this study highlight that conservation management for this and many other threatened species should regard the urban landscape as a critical habitat for urban adapted species. This would include management of its green spaces with connectivity and offsets from roads in mind. Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying additional key habitat sites (resource selection) and species distribution modeling, which will facilitate an active and adaptive approach towards this species' conservation management.
RÉSUMÉ
Les modifications anthropiques du paysage, qui entraînent le déplacement des espèces, représentent sans doute l'un des impacts les plus néfastes sur les déplacements des animaux dans le monde. En paysage urbain, les déplacements des animaux sont généralement affectés par des degrés variables d'urbanisation galopante. Cependant, ce phénomène dépend des espèces et est principalement guidé par l'habitat environnant. La fragmentation et l'isolement des parcelles d'habitat doivent être pris en compte à des échelles appropriées à l'espèce étudiée. Au moyen de la télémétrie, nous avons testé ces hypothèses en examinant les schémas de déplacement de groupes de Cacatoès banksiens (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso) entre trois régions : urbaine, périurbaine et forestière, en utilisant le GPS et des émetteurs satellitaires. Cette espèce est présente à divers degrés d'urbanisation, mais la manière dont cela peut affecter ses déplacements est largement inconnue. D'après nos données, les déplacements du cacatoès n'étaient pas restreints en région urbaine par rapport aux régions périurbaines ou forestières. Nous avons cependant constaté, au sein d'une même région, une variation significative de l'étendue des déplacements entre les groupes et pour toutes les régions, selon la disponibilité et la localisation des ressources alimentaires. Les différences de la distance de déplacement quotidien (moyenne = 4,96 - 16,41 km) et de la taille du domaine vital (6,02 - 52,57 km2) entre les groupes urbains semblent être associées à la proximité d'espaces verts comme dortoirs et sites de recherche de nourriture, la végétation en bordure de route fournissant d'importants lieux de quête de nourriture et des corridors de déplacement. Les habitats urbains clés étaient principalement situés dans des réserves naturelles publiques et sur des propriétés privées, la végétation en bordure de route permettant de relier ces sites pour le cacatoès. Les résultats de la présente étude soulignent que la gestion de la conservation de cette espèce et de nombreuses autres espèces menacées devrait considérer le paysage urbain comme un habitat essentiel pour les espèces adaptées à la ville. Ainsi, la gestion des espaces verts devrait tenir compte de la connectivité et de compensations pour les routes. De plus, de futures recherches devraient se pencher sur l'identification de sites d'habitats clés supplémentaires (sélection de ressources) et la modélisation de la répartition de l'espèce, ce qui facilitera une approche active et adaptative de la gestion de la conservation de cette espèce.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art11/ACE-ECO-2021-2061.pdf,ace-eco.org,cockatoo,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-10.3234384297316,"['calyptorhynchus banksii', 'ou']",50

Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) breeding populations in inland North America have declined significantly since the 1970s. A 2012 survey of the large Manitoba lakes, previously the largest known inland population stronghold, reported a 57–67% decline in 20 years. A further 38% decline by 2017 highlights the urgent need for research and management. We use ground-based estimates of productivity and analysis of microsatellite markers to provide the first detailed insight into breeding status and movements of Common Terns in this region. At six breeding colonies in 2012, we recorded breeding success in fenced plots, counted fledglings, documented predators and floods, and collected blood samples for microsatellite analysis of movement. Productivity ranged from 0.0 to 2.0 chicks fledged per nest, being highest at large colonies (> 1000 nests) located far away from human settlements (20–30 km). Large-scale breeding failure from predation occurred at smaller colonies close to human settlement. The most common predators were Black-crowned Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), but we also report three novel predators: Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), gray wolves (Canis lupus), and river otters (Lontra canadensis). Microsatellite analysis suggested little eastward emigration, but instead a 100-fold increase in immigration from the Great Lakes between the 1990s and 2010s. Substantial population declines in the Manitoba Lakes despite this influx imply that net losses are occurring within inland-breeding populations. Terns now appear to switch frequently between breeding colonies in the region, possibly in response to predation and/or flooding. Although some colonies achieved productivity during the one-year study, continued population decline indicates that monitoring and studies of adult survival and movement are needed, especially given the on-going environmental changes within the region. Only by coupling these data with further efforts in unsurveyed boreal regions can the status of inland-breeding Common Terns be determined and strategies developed to curb apparent, large-scale population declines.
RESUME_
Les populations nicheuses de Sternes pierregarins (Sterna hirundo) dans les régions intérieures de l'Amérique du Nord ont diminué de façon marquée depuis les années 1970. Un relevé réalisé en 2012 sur les grands lacs du Manitoba, qui constituaient auparavant le plus grand bastion connu de la population intérieure, a révélé une baisse de 57 à 67 % en 20 ans. Une nouvelle diminution de 38 % en 2017 souligne le besoin urgent de recherche et de gestion. Nous avons utilisé des estimations de productivité réalisées sur le terrain et l'analyse de marqueurs microsatellites pour fournir le premier rapport détaillé du statut de reproduction et des déplacements des Sternes pierregarins dans cette région. En 2012, dans six colonies de nidification, nous avons noté le succès de reproduction dans des parcelles clôturées, compté les oisillons, documenté les prédateurs et les inondations, et collecté des échantillons sanguins en vue d'effectuer une analyse microsatellite des déplacements. La productivité a varié de 0,0 à 2,0 oisillons envolés par nid, étant le plus élevée dans les grandes colonies (> 1000 nids) situées loin des établissements humains (20-30 km). Des échecs de reproduction à grande échelle attribuables à la prédation se sont produits dans les petites colonies proches des établissements humains. Les prédateurs les plus courants étaient le Bihoreau gris (Nycticorax nycticorax) et le Grand-duc d'Amérique (Bubo virginianus), mais nous signalons également trois nouveaux prédateurs : le Pygargue à tête blanche (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), le Loup gris (Canis lupus) et la Loutre de rivière (Lontra canadensis). L'analyse des microsatellites a indiqué une faible émigration vers l'est, mais révélé une immigration en provenance des Grands Lacs multipliée par 100 entre les années 1990 et 2010. Les baisses substantielles de population dans les lacs du Manitoba, malgré cet afflux, sous-tendent que des pertes nettes se produisent au sein des populations se reproduisant à l'intérieur des terres. Les sternes semblent maintenant changer fréquemment de colonie de nidification dans la région, peut-être en raison de la prédation et/ou des inondations. Bien que certaines colonies aient atteint un niveau de productivité satisfaisant au cours de l'étude d'un an, la baisse continue de la population indique que le suivi et l'étude de la survie et des déplacements des adultes sont nécessaires, en particulier compte tenu des changements environnementaux en cours dans la région. Ce n'est qu'en associant ces données à d'autres activités réalisées dans des régions boréales non étudiées que l'on pourra déterminer le statut des Sternes pierregarins nichant à l'intérieur des terres et élaborer des stratégies pour enrayer le déclin apparent et à grande échelle des populations.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art14/ACE-ECO-2021-2067.pdf,ace-eco.org,paradisaea,2022-04-19,0,0,1,1,1,-10.325533680015088,"['haliaeetus leucocephalus', 'bubo virginianus', 'ou', 'common tern', 'sterna hirundo', 'nycticorax nycticorax']",50

Dysbiosis within the gut ecosystem has been associated with the development of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, the metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colorectal cancer, type 1 diabetes, allergies and other diseases. The purpose of this comprehensive literature review was to evaluate the available data on the impact of diet on the Prevotella genus, as a dietary fibre fermenter in the gut as well as its implications as a potential biomarker for homeostasis or disease state through its metabolite signature. Studies were identified by conducting PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection and Google Scholar electronic searches. We found eighty-five publications reporting the impact of dietary patterns on gut microbial communities, including Prevotella or Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio in particular. Moreover, the role of Prevotella species on health status was also evaluated. Prevotella possess a high genetic diversity, representing one of the important groups found in the oral cavity and large intestine of man. The gut commensal Prevotella bacteria contribute to polysaccharide breakdown, being dominant colonisers of agrarian societies. However, studies also suggested a potential role of Prevotella species as intestinal pathobionts.

This study examines the occurrence and underlying factors of onshore strandings of two species of seabirds breeding in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) are found stranded in coastal communities bordering the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve in artificially lit areas. Between 2011 and 2020, 3845 recently fledged puffins were found during nightly searches. Counts of puffins found per night were related to the phase of the moon, with the fewest birds found around the full moon. Mean annual body mass of pufflings was positively associated with annual recovery rates, providing a non-intrusive approach to monitor inter-annual productivity at the colony. Using two approaches to estimate population impacts of strandings, we estimate that < 0.2% of fledging chicks were attracted to lights emitted from coastal communities. Despite bordering two of the largest Leach's Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) colonies in Newfoundland, this species was rarely observed stranded in the Witless Bay area. Rather, most of the 1903 stranded storm-petrels reported in 2018 and 2019 were found on industrial properties bordering, or inland of, Conception Bay, at minimal distances of 25 km inland from the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve. Most storm-petrels were recently fledged juveniles. Strandings were less likely to occur around the full moon. Neither strong nor persistent winds were observed during nights of large stranding events, however, these nights tended to have winds coming from the north, suggesting that stranded storm-petrels fledged from Baccalieu Island, located at the mouth of Conception Bay and hosting the largest colony in the world. Stronger mitigation measures to avoid and minimize light emittance, as well as research investigating light characteristics to reduce attraction, are urgently needed to decrease unnecessary strandings, particularly for the Leach's Storm-Petrel, recently assessed as Threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.
RÉSUMÉ
Cette étude porte sur l'occurrence et les facteurs sous-jacents l'échouement terrestre de deux espèces d'oiseaux marins nichant en Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador, au Canada. Les Macareux moines (Fratercula arctica) sont retrouvés échoués dans des communautés côtières bordant la réserve écologique de Witless Bay, aux endroits éclairés artificiellement. Entre 2011 et 2020, 3845 macareux ayant récemment pris leur envol ont été trouvés lors de recherches nocturnes. Le nombre de macareux trouvés par nuit était lié à la phase de la lune; il était à son minimum autour de la pleine lune. La masse corporelle annuelle moyenne des jeunes macareux était positivement associée au taux de récupération annuel, fournissant une approche non-intrusive pour surveiller la productivité interannuelle de la colonie. Au moyen de deux approches pour estimer les impacts des échouements sur la population, nous avons calculé que < 0,2 % des jeunes à l'envol ont été attirés par les lumières émises par les communautés côtières. Bien que deux des plus grandes colonies d'Océanites cul-blanc (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) de Terre-Neuve se trouvent dans la région de Witless Bay, cette espèce y a rarement été trouvée échouée. Au contraire, la plupart des 1903 océanites échoués signalés en 2018 et 2019 ont été trouvés sur des propriétés industrielles bordant la baie Conception ou à l'intérieur des terres, à des distances minimales de 25 km de la réserve écologique de Witless Bay. La plupart des océanites étaient des jeunes ayant récemment pris leur envol. Les échouements étaient moins susceptibles de se produire autour de la pleine lune. Aucun vent fort ou persistant n'a été observé au cours des nuits d'échouements importants, mais des vents venant du nord soufflaient durant ces nuits, donnant à penser que les océanites échoués avaient pris leur envol de l'île Baccalieu, située à l'embouchure de la baie Conception et abritant la plus grande colonie au monde. Il est de toute urgence nécessaire d'appliquer des mesures d'atténuation plus strictes pour éviter et minimiser l'émission de lumière, et de faire des recherches sur les caractéristiques de la lumière pour en réduire l'attraction, afin de diminuer les échouements inutiles, en particulier pour l'Océanite cul-blanc, qui vient de se voir attribuer le statut de « menacé » par le Comité sur la situation des espèces en péril au Canada.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art12/ACE-ECO-2021-1809.pdf,ace-eco.org,donaldson-smith,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.3329527070304,"['oceanodroma leucorhoa', 'ou', 'fratercula arctica']",384

Monitoring population trends for bird species in the Arctic and sub-Arctic can be difficult and cost prohibitive. Breeding populations of birds in these remote locations may be changing and have garnered much attention regarding their conservation. We analyzed data from bird lists (daily species observations) collected while conducting other targeted research to estimate trends in the probability of observing species at two sub-Arctic study sites. For Akimiski Island, Nunavut (52 species) we estimated positive trends with high confidence (95% credible limits do not include 0) for 14 species and negative trends with high confidence for 18. For Burntpoint Creek, Ontario (46 species) we estimated that 12 species had positive trends with high confidence and 12 had negative trends with high confidence. More than 60% of species at each site matched population trends for at least one of three larger geographic scales that we compared estimates with; regional, provincial and national. We hypothesized that trends may be due to climate change effects or because of effects related to intensive herbivory from nesting geese. Trends for most of the species where we made specific predictions from these hypotheses agreed with those predicted; however, well-designed experiments are needed to conclusively determine the driving mechanisms of these trends. Collecting bird list data while simultaneously conducting other research is not nearly as time consuming or expensive as targeted breeding bird surveys (e.g., point counts, call counts, nest searching, etc.). This analysis method may be of utility for other remote field study sites where gaps in trend data exist.
RÉSUMÉ
Le suivi de la tendance des populations d'oiseaux dans l'Arctique et le subarctique peut être difficile et son coût prohibitif. Les populations d'oiseaux nicheurs dans ces endroits éloignés sont peut-être en train de changer et leur conservation a suscité beaucoup d'attention. Nous avons analysé les données de listes d'oiseaux (observations quotidiennes d'espèces) recueillies lors d'autres recherches ciblées afin d'estimer la tendance de la probabilité d'observer des espèces à deux sites d'étude subarctiques. Pour l'île Akimiski, au Nunavut (52 espèces), nous avons calculé des tendances positives avec un niveau de confiance élevé (les limites crédibles à 95 % ne comprennent pas les 0) pour 14 espèces et des tendances négatives avec un niveau de confiance élevé pour 18 autres. Pour le ruisseau Burntpoint, en Ontario (46 espèces), nous avons déterminé que 12 espèces présentaient des tendances positives avec un niveau de confiance élevé et 12 des tendances négatives avec un niveau de confiance élevé. La tendance de plus de 60 % des espèces à chaque site correspondait aux tendances de populations d'au moins une des trois grandes échelles géographiques avec lesquelles nous avons comparé les résultats : régionale, provinciale et nationale. Nous avons émis l'hypothèse selon laquelle les tendances pouvaient être imputables aux effets du changement climatique ou aux effets liés au broutement intensif des oies nicheuses. Les tendances pour la plupart des espèces pour lesquelles nous avons fait des prédictions spécifiques à partir de ces hypothèses corroboraient celles prédites; toutefois, des protocoles expérimentaux bien conçus sont nécessaires pour déterminer de manière concluante les mécanismes moteurs de ces tendances. La collecte d'observations au moyen de listes d'oiseaux, tout en menant simultanément d'autres recherches, est loin d'être aussi longue et coûteuse que les suivis ciblés d'oiseaux nicheurs (p. ex. dénombrement par points d'écoute, relevé de chants, recherche de nids, etc.).

Seasonal migration is an important part of the annual cycle for migratory birds, and it is associated with large time and energy expenditures. One migration strategy used by many raptors and aerial foragers is fly-and-forage migration. Fly-and-forage migrants combine migratory flights with foraging to maximize travel speeds. We examine the fall migratory movements of a declining population of Bank SwallowsRiparia ripariathat breed in Atlantic Canada, and winter between northern Argentina and southern Brazil. We tagged breeding adults with small VHF transmitters in 2014, 2015, and 2018, and tracked them with the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. For each individual we determined a departure date (last detection at the breeding colony), a departure bearing, the broad-scale migratory pathway (east or west of the Adirondack Mountains), and the pace of the migratory journey. Bank Swallows departed from their breeding colonies throughout July and August and most individuals departed in a southwest to westerly direction, consistent with their subsequent migratory pathway along the Atlantic Coast. The pace of the migratory journey was slower than that observed for other migratory passerines, suggesting individuals used stopover sites during migration and/or foraged while migrating. Travel speeds were also slower for female, compared to male Bank Swallows, possibly because of sex-related differences in refueling and/or carry-over effects from the breeding season. Collectively, the results suggest that Bank Swallows use a fly-and-forage migration strategy, and fall migration movements are consistent with an energy-limiting strategy.
RÉSUMÉ
Les migrations saisonnières constituent une grande part du cycle annuel chez les oiseaux migrateurs, et elles sont associées à des demandes temporelle et énergétique importantes. La migration combinant le vol et l'alimentation est une stratégie de migration utilisée par de nombreux oiseaux de proie et insectivores aériens. Dans cette stratégie de migration, les vols migratoires alternent avec ceux pour s'alimenter afin de maximiser la vitesse de déplacement. Nous avons examiné les déplacements migratoires automnaux d'une population d'Hirondelles de rivage Riparia riparia en diminution, qui niche dans le Canada Atlantique et hiverne entre le nord de l'Argentine et le sud du Brésil. Nous avons marqué des adultes nicheurs au moyen de petits émetteurs VHF en 2014, 2015 et 2018, et les avons suivis à l'aide du système de surveillance de la faune Motus. Nous avons déterminé la date de départ (dernière détection à la colonie de nidification), l'azimut pris, le trajet migratoire général (est ou ouest des Adirondacks) et la vitesse de migration de chaque individu. Les hirondelles ont quitté leur colonie de nidification en juillet et août et la plupart des individus ont pris un cap sud-ouest à ouest, conséquent avec leur trajectoire de migration subséquente le long de la côte atlantique. Le rythme migratoire était plus lent que celui d'autres passereaux migratoires, laissant croire que les individus utilisaient des haltes durant la migration et/ou s'alimentaient en vol tout en migrant. Les vitesses de déplacement étaient aussi plus lentes chez les femelles, comparativement à celles des mâles, peut-être en raison de différences liées au sexe dans la façon de refaire ses réserves et/ou d'effets reportés de la saison de nidification. Dans l'ensemble, nos résultats indiquent que les Hirondelles de rivage utilisent une stratégie de migration combinant le vol et l'alimentation, et leurs déplacements migratoires automnaux correspondent à une stratégie limitant les dépenses énergétiques.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art2/ACE-ECO-2019-1463.pdf,ace-eco.org,piha,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-10.3646894278557,"['riparia riparia', 'ou']",809

To understand the developmental mechanisms underlying this morphological diversity, we conducted a series of comparative analyses. Ancestral state reconstruction based on phylogeny assumed that the lobate feet possessed by the common coot and little grebe arose independently, perhaps through distinct developmental mechanisms. Gremlin1, which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and inhibits interdigital cell death (ICD) in the foot plate of avian embryos, remained expressed in the interdigital tissues of webbed feet in the duck, common coot, little grebe, and great cormorant. Differences in Gremlin1 expression pattern and proliferating cell distribution pattern in the toe tissues of the common coot and little grebe support the convergent evolution of lobate feet. In the totipalmate-footed great cormorant, Gremlin1 was expressed in all interdigital tissues at St. 31, but its expression disappeared except along the toes by St. 33.

Intentional poisoning is a common practice to reduce bird damage to agricultural crops. Understanding the extent, distribution, and influencing factors of such incidents is key to reducing poisoning of farmland birds and scavengers which are threatened via secondary poisoning. We recruited volunteers to look for dead birds in red bean (Vigna angularis) farms during the seeding period in autumn 2016. A total of 5,441 fields were surveyed, and 51 bird poisoning incidents were identified. We recorded 1,995 dead birds during the survey (39.1 ± 29.7 per incident ± SD), mostly seed-eating birds. We tested two possible factors influencing the practice of intentional poisoning: seeding methods and whether the red bean farm was adjacent to duck farms. Among three seeding methods, broadcast seeding does not cover the seeds with soils and resulted in a significantly higher proportion of bird poisoning incidents when compared to the whole study area. However, when red bean farms were adjacent to the duck farms, there were no differences in the percentage of poisoning incidents among seeding methods but the number of dead birds was two times higher compared to incidents that were not adjacent to the duck farms. We suspect that birds congregating at duck farms resulted in neighboring farmers taking anti-bird measures, regardless of seeding methods. We map bird poisoning hot spots and provide evidence that changing seeding method and limiting the number of wild birds congregating near duck farms would help reduce bird damage and intentional bird poisoning on red bean farms. Finally, we demonstrated that citizen scientists can make a significant contribution to conservation.

We estimated distribution, abundance, and spatially explicit population trend of 20 breeding waterbird species using 25 years (1992–2016) of aerial survey data collected on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), Alaska. The ACP is an extensive wetland complex on Alaska’s North Slope that supports millions of breeding waterbirds and includes portions of the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We summarized annual counts into approximately 6-km by 6-km grid cells and analyzed data with generalized linear mixed models that accounted for survey timing and spatio-temporal autocorrelation. Geese and swans were most abundant along the coast between Admiralty Bay and Prudhoe Bay. Sea ducks, generalist predators (i.e., jaeger, gulls, terns), and loons were most abundant between Utqiaġvik and Point Lay, Alaska. Important areas for most species included the coastal fringe near Teshekpuk Lake, the Colville River Delta, and Admiralty Bay. The National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska was an important area for all species examined. Conversely, density on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was greater than average for 20% of species. Annual population growth rates over the 25-year survey period were variable: 13 increased (range: 1.4%–13.8%), one decreased (-3.4%), and six were stable. However, even species with no overall population trend had areas of changing population size, suggesting localized conditions affected waterbird distributions on the ACP. Our results can be used to better inform land use decisions, improve monitoring of waterbird populations, and increase understanding of avian response to ecological change in the Arctic.

Located in the northeastern portion of the Canadian province of Alberta, the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) supports large-scale bitumen mining operations. Such development has considerable impacts upon the landscape; however, upland habitat reclamation is underway, providing an opportunity to assess wildlife usage patterns associated with reclaimed habitats relatively early in the reclamation process. Using passerines and woodpeckers as an indicator of wildlife usage of landforms reclaimed to an upland forest type consistent with the surrounding and naturally occurring upland boreal forest, across six oil sands leases in the mineable portion of the oil sands region, we observed that reclaimed areas increased in community similarity to reference mature boreal forest plots over 35 years. Community similarity 35 years post-disturbance between reference and reclaimed sites varied from 20-65%, with an overall average of ~43%. Such low and variable similarity values were expected, as 35 years is early in the recovery process from the perspective of forest succession. Younger plots disturbed by activities other than mining, such as fire and logging (9 to 10 years post-disturbance), were associated with bird communities that were more similar to older reclaimed plots (those >30 years post-reclamation) suggesting that areas not disturbed by mining are progressing along different recovery trajectories than areas disturbed by mining. Given the time it takes for vegetation communities in the boreal to mature, continued research is required to assess the longer-term functionality of reclaimed habitats, the end point of succession in all disturbed habitat types, as well as to determine what level of community similarity between reference and reclaimed plots is satisfactory from an ecological and regulatory perspective. Despite the observed differences between reclaimed habitats and mature forests, reclamation efforts in the mineable portion of the AOSR appear to be contributing to the development of upland boreal forest habitats that resemble those of the surrounding and naturally occurring boreal forest.
RÉSUMÉ
Située dans la partie nord-est de la province canadienne de l'Alberta, la région des sables bitumineux de l'Athabasca (RSBA) est le théâtre d'opérations d'exploitation du bitume à grande échelle. Ce type d'exploitation a des répercussions considérables sur le paysage; toutefois, la remise en état d'habitats situés en terrain sec est en cours, ce qui permet d'évaluer les habitudes d'utilisation de la faune associées aux milieux remis en état relativement tôt dans le processus de restauration. Nous avons utilisé les passereaux et les pics comme indicateurs de l'utilisation par la faune de milieux restaurés en un type de forêt poussant en terrain sec ressemblant à la forêt boréale naturelle environnante, dans six concessions de sables bitumineux de la partie exploitable de la RSBA. La similarité entre les communautés des zones restaurées et celles des parcelles de forêt boréale mature de référence a augmenté sur la période de 35 ans. Cette similarité de communautés 35 ans après la perturbation a varié de 20 à 65 %, la moyenne se situant à ~43 %. Des valeurs de similarité aussi faibles et variables étaient prévisibles étant donné que la période de 35 ans correspond au début du processus de rétablissement du point de vue de la succession forestière. Les parcelles plus jeunes et ayant été perturbées par des activités autres que l'exploitation minière, telles que les incendies et l'exploitation forestière (9 à 10 ans après la perturbation), étaient associées à des communautés d'oiseaux davantage similaires à celles de parcelles restaurées plus anciennes (> 30 ans après la restauration), ce qui laisse entrevoir que le rétablissement des zones non perturbées par l'exploitation minière suit une trajectoire différente de celui des zones perturbées par l'exploitation minière. Considérant que les communautés végétales de la région boréale prennent du temps pour arriver à maturité, il est nécessaire de poursuivre les recherches afin d'évaluer la fonctionnalité à long terme des milieux remis en état, d'établir quel est le stade final de la succession dans tous les types d'habitats perturbés, et de déterminer quel niveau de similitude des communautés entre les parcelles de référence et les parcelles remises en état est satisfaisant d'un point de vue écologique et réglementaire. Malgré les différences observées entre les milieux remis en état et les forêts matures, les efforts de remise en état dans la partie exploitable de la RSBA semblent contribuer au rétablissement d'habitats de forêt boréale poussant en terrain sec qui ressemblent à ceux de la forêt boréale naturelle environnante.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art5/ACE-ECO-2021-1915.pdf,ace-eco.org,tanager-finch,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.4220303513265,,262
2019-07-01,http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art4/,"Avian Conservation and Ecology: Foxes, voles, and waders ...","Foxes are a generalist predator whose varied diet predominantly comprises small mammals (Forman 2005, Dell'Arte et al. 2007). Small mammal distribution could thus be an important driver of fox activity and distribution, and the associated nest predation risk experienced by ground-nesting birds.",en,"Foxes, voles, and waders: drivers of predator activity in wet grassland landscapes","ABSTRACT
Impacts of generalist predators on declining prey populations are a major conservation issue, but management of this situation is constrained by limited knowledge of the factors influencing predator distribution and activity. In many declining populations of ground-nesting waders, high levels of nest and chick predation are preventing population recovery. Red foxes,Vulpes vulpes,are the main predator but their primary prey is small mammals. On wet grasslands managed for breeding waders, small mammals are concentrated in tall vegetation outside of fields, and nests closer to these patches are less likely to be predated. To assess whether these patterns result from fox attraction to small mammals, and thus the potential for management of tall vegetation to influence nest predation rates, we quantify seasonal and spatial variation in fox and small mammal activity in relation to tall vegetation patches. Across wet grassland sites, tall vegetation patches of any size (> 0.05 ha) supported small mammals and small mammal activity increased throughout the wader breeding season, while the use of fox track plots within fields declined seasonally. Although within field fox track plot use did not vary with distance to tall vegetation, over the 1064 nights of trail camera recording, foxes were seen in areas with tall vegetation on 13 nights compared with short vegetation on only two nights. These findings suggest that lower predation rates of Lapwing,Vanellus vanellus,nests close to tall vegetation could reflect fox attraction to areas with small mammal activity, but any such effects would primarily operate later in the breeding season, and may therefore primarily influence late nests and chicks.
RÉSUMÉ
L'impact des prédateurs généralistes sur le déclin des populations de proies constitue un problème majeur en termes de conservation. Toutefois, la gestion de ce problème est entravée par des connaissances limitées quant aux facteurs qui influencent la répartition et l'activité des prédateurs. Dans de nombreuses populations déclinantes d'échassiers à nidification terrestre, un niveau élevé de prédation des nids et des petits empêche la reprise de l'augmentation des populations. Le renard roux, Vulpes vulpes, est le principal prédateur, mais il se nourrit essentiellement de petits mammifères.

Impacts of generalist predators on declining prey populations are a major conservation issue, but management of this situation is constrained by limited knowledge of the factors influencing predator distribution and activity. In many declining populations of ground-nesting waders, high levels of nest and chick predation are preventing population recovery. Red foxes,Vulpes vulpes,are the main predator but their primary prey is small mammals. On wet grasslands managed for breeding waders, small mammals are concentrated in tall vegetation outside of fields, and nests closer to these patches are less likely to be predated. To assess whether these patterns result from fox attraction to small mammals, and thus the potential for management of tall vegetation to influence nest predation rates, we quantify seasonal and spatial variation in fox and small mammal activity in relation to tall vegetation patches. Across wet grassland sites, tall vegetation patches of any size (> 0.05 ha) supported small mammals and small mammal activity increased throughout the wader breeding season, while the use of fox track plots within fields declined seasonally. Although within field fox track plot use did not vary with distance to tall vegetation, over the 1064 nights of trail camera recording, foxes were seen in areas with tall vegetation on 13 nights compared with short vegetation on only two nights. These findings suggest that lower predation rates of Lapwing,Vanellus vanellus,nests close to tall vegetation could reflect fox attraction to areas with small mammal activity, but any such effects would primarily operate later in the breeding season, and may therefore primarily influence late nests and chicks.
RÉSUMÉ
L'impact des prédateurs généralistes sur le déclin des populations de proies constitue un problème majeur en termes de conservation. Toutefois, la gestion de ce problème est entravée par des connaissances limitées quant aux facteurs qui influencent la répartition et l'activité des prédateurs. Dans de nombreuses populations déclinantes d'échassiers à nidification terrestre, un niveau élevé de prédation des nids et des petits empêche la reprise de l'augmentation des populations. Le renard roux, Vulpes vulpes, est le principal prédateur, mais il se nourrit essentiellement de petits mammifères. Dans les prairies humides gérées pour les échassiers nidificateurs, les petits mammifères sont concentrés dans les hautes herbes qui bordent les champs et les nids les plus proches de ces espaces sont les moins susceptibles d'être attaqués. Pour savoir si ces modèles résultent de l'attirance du renard pour les petits mammifères, et par conséquent, pour estimer le potentiel de gestion de la végétation en vue d'influencer les taux de prédation des nids, nous quantifions les variations saisonnières et en termes de localisation par rapport à l'activité des renards et des petits mammifères en relation avec les zones de hautes herbes.

The insectivorous feeding habit is related to low prevalence and density of coccidians in passerines; however, several coccidian species are recorded for families of insectivorous passerines. Purpose This study aimed to examine the feces from gnateaters Conopophaga spp. captured in the municipality of Barra Mansa and in the Itatiaia National Park, State of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil, to determine what coccidian parasites were present. Methods Nine gnateaters were captured with mist nets. Coccidian oocysts were recovered from the fecal samples by flotation in Sheather’s saturated solution. Morphological observations, line drawings, photomicrographs and measurements were made in optical microscopy and digitally edited. The molecular analysis included the study of the sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene, with phylogenetic reconstructions based on the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analysis. Results Four Conopophaga spp. were positive for oocysts. An Isospora sp. considered as new to science is described and identified from Conopophaga melanops (Vieillot, 1818) and Conopophaga lineata (Wied, 1831). Isospora borbai n. sp. has oocysts that are subspheroidal, 17–22 × 15–22 (20.2 × 19.1) µm, with rough, bilayered wall, c.1.7 μm thick. Micropyle present, but without micropyle cap. Oocyst residuum absent, but one or two polar granules are present. Sporocysts are ellipsoidal, 12–15 × 8–11 (14.1 × 9.1) µm. The Stieda body is knob-like to half-moon-shaped and sub-Stieda body is rounded. Sporocyst residuum is present, composed of scattered spherules of different sizes. Sporozoites are vermiform with refractile body and nucleus. Molecular analysis at the cox1 gene exhibited similarity greater than 99% with Isospora spp. isolates from other Neotropical passerine birds.

More people are engaging in recreation on public lands in the United States than ever before. However, increased recreation can be detrimental to wildlife species. Managers need to understand how recreational activities, such as driving motor vehicles through natural areas, can affect a range of species so that they can balance access to nature with preservation of wildlife communities. We assessed the effect of off-highway vehicle (OHV) use and OHV trail density on the abundance and diversity of bird species across Hollister Hills State Vehicle Recreation Area in California, USA. We collected data during three winter and two spring seasons spanning 2012 to 2014. We used a hierarchical community distance sampling model to compare bird community and species-level abundance for 30 species in spring and 18 species in winter and used raw counts of birds to compare Shannon diversity between OHV use and nonOHV use areas. Community-level bird abundance increased significantly with OHV trail density in both winter and spring and was significantly greater in OHV use areas than in nonOHV use areas during the winter, but not spring. Seven and eight species, in spring and winter respectively, were significantly more abundant with greater OHV trail cover, and none was significantly less abundant. OHV use had no significant effect on Shannon diversity. Thus, OHV recreation appears to have had nonnegative effects on abundance and no discernable effect on diversity of birds at Hollister Hills. Abundance is not always a good predictor of habitat quality, however, so further research is needed to understand the demographic consequences of OHV use on bird species.
RÉSUMÉ
Le nombre de personnes pratiquant des loisirs sur des terrains publics aux États-Unis est plus élevé que jamais. Toutefois, cette augmentation des loisirs risque de nuire à certaines espèces sauvages. Les responsables doivent comprendre l'influence que peuvent avoir des activités de loisirs, telles que la conduite de véhicules à moteur dans des zones naturelles, sur différentes espèces, afin de trouver un juste équilibre entre l'accès à la nature et la protection des populations animales. Nous avons évalué les effets de l'utilisation de véhicules hors route (VHR) et de la densité de pistes pour VHR sur l'abondance et la diversité des espèces d'oiseaux dans la zone de loisirs d'état pour véhicules de Hollister Hills, en Californie. Nous avons collecté des données au cours de trois hivers et deux printemps de 2012 à 2014. Nous avons utilisé un modèle hiérarchisé d'échantillonnage de distance entre les communautés afin de comparer la population aviaire et l'abondance au niveau des espèces pour 30 espèces au printemps et 18 espèces en hiver. Nous avons utilisé le nombre brut d'oiseaux pour comparer la diversité de Shannon entre des zones d'utilisation et de non-utilisation de VHR. L'abondance d'oiseaux au niveau des communautés a nettement augmenté avec la densité des pistes pour VHR à la fois en hiver et au printemps et était nettement plus élevée dans les zones d'utilisation de VHR que dans les zones sans VHR pendant l'hiver, mais pas au printemps. Sept et huit espèces, au printemps et en hiver respectivement, étaient nettement plus abondantes dans les zones contenant davantage de pistes pour VHR, et aucune espèce n'y était moins abondante. L'utilisation de VHR n'avait pas d'effet significatif sur la diversité de Shannon. En conséquence, les loisirs utilisant des VHR semblent avoir eu des effets non-négatifs sur l'abondance et aucun effet perceptible sur la diversité des oiseaux à Hollister Hills. L'abondance n'est cependant pas toujours un bon indicateur de la qualité de l'habitat, de sorte que d'autres recherches sont nécessaires pour comprendre les conséquences démographiques de l'utilisation de VHR sur les espèces d'oiseaux.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art9/ACE-ECO-2019-1422.pdf,ace-eco.org,dunes,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.4493683391402,,993

Recent research on boreal birds has focused on understanding effects of human activity on populations and their habitats. As bird populations continue to decline, research is often intended to inform conservation and management policies and practices. Research produced under the typical “loading dock” model by Western-trained researchers often fails to achieve desired conservation outcomes. There is growing global consensus that science is most actionable when produced in collaboration between scientists, potential end-users of the science, and communities implicated in or affected by the research and its outcomes. A fully collaborative research process, which we call “coproduced research,” involves partners in the design, execution, and communication of research. To coproduce research, it is first important to understand the sociocultural context of a research project. For boreal bird conservation in Canada, this context includes complex linkages between Indigenous communities, governments, and rights-holders, multiple levels of government, nonprofit organizations, companies, and industry consortiums, civic communities, and others. We explain this context, and give particular attention to best practices for coproduction of research between non-Indigenous researchers and Indigenous partners. We also introduce a self-assessment tool for researchers to gauge the strength of their relationships with potential partners.

 We highlight the challenges of doing coproduced research, including cross-cultural communication and lengthy timelines to build relationships. We propose a guide for coproduced research in four stages: (1) identify potential partners; (2) build relationships; (3) identify mechanisms to inform policy and management; and (4) execute research and communications plans. We illustrate the stages with examples of “bright spots” to demonstrate successful coproduction partnerships. Although we focus on research to improve knowledge for boreal bird conservation and management, many of the lessons we share for adopting a coproduced research model would apply to terrestrial or marine wildlife, or any natural resource.
RÉSUMÉ
Les recherches récentes au sujet des oiseaux des régions boréales portaient principalement sur la compréhension des effets de l'activité humaine sur les populations et leurs habitats. Alors que le déclin des populations aviaires se poursuit, les recherches ont souvent pour objectif d'informer les politiques et les pratiques en matière de conservation et de gestion. Toutefois, les recherches réalisées selon le modèle typique de la science « brute » par les chercheurs de formation occidentale ne produisent généralement pas les résultats souhaités en termes de conservation. Il semble de plus en plus communément admis que la science est plus exploitable lorsqu'elle est le fruit d'une collaboration entre scientifiques, utilisateurs finaux potentiels et communautés impliquées ou concernées par la recherche et ses résultats. Un processus de recherche entièrement collaboratif, que nous appelons « recherche en coproduction », fait intervenir des partenaires dans la conception, l'exécution et la communication des résultats. Pour coproduire la recherche, il faut avant tout comprendre le contexte socioculturel d'un projet. En ce qui concerne la conservation des oiseaux des régions boréales du Canada, ce contexte fait appel à des liens complexes entre les populations indigènes, les gouvernements, les ayant-droits, de multiples niveaux de l'administration, des organisations à but non lucratif, des entreprises et des consortiums industriels, des associations civiques et autres. Nous expliquerons ce contexte et accorderons une attention toute particulière aux bonnes pratiques en matière de coproduction de la recherche entre chercheurs non-indigènes et partenaires indigènes. Nous présenterons également un outil d'auto-évaluation qui permet aux chercheurs d'estimer la solidité de leurs relations avec des partenaires potentiels. 

 Nous mettrons en évidence les défis inhérents à la recherche en coproduction, y compris la communication interculturelle et les longs délais nécessaires à l'élaboration des relations. Nous proposons un guide de la recherche en coproduction en quatre étapes : (1) identification des partenaires potentiels ; (2) création des relations ; (3) identification des mécanismes permettant d'informer la politique et la gestion ; et (4) exécution des plans de recherche et de communications. Nous illustrons ces différentes étapes à l'aide d'exemples de « points positifs » qui présentent des partenariats de coproduction efficaces. Même si nous nous concentrons sur des recherches visant à améliorer nos connaissances en matière de conservation et de gestion des populations d'oiseaux des régions boréales, bon nombre des enseignements que nous partageons pour adopter un modèle de recherche en coproduction pourraient également s'appliquer à la faune terrestre ou marine ou à toute ressource naturelle.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art26/ACE-ECO-2020-1589.pdf,ace-eco.org,verdin,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-10.468224026203334,['ou'],688

RÉSUMÉ
Les goélands (Larus spp.) sont décrits comme des mangeurs généralistes et opportunistes qui font preuve d'une grande souplesse dans l'utilisation de leur habitat. Malgré un certain avantage procuré par la modification des paysages, de nombreuses populations de Larus ont diminué dans l'est de l'Amérique du Nord depuis les années 1990. La principale hypothèse derrière cette diminution à grande échelle serait la baisse de la disponibilité générale de nourriture, en particulier de rejets de pêche d'origine anthropique et de déchets d'origine humaine, les industries et les villes ayant amélioré leurs pratiques de gestion. Cependant, il est difficile de quantifier la proportion totale du régime alimentaire des goélands fournie par l'homme pour tester cette hypothèse, car de nombreuses proies communes peuvent provenir à la fois de sources anthropiques ou non anthropiques. Notre objectif était de calculer la proportion du régime alimentaire provenant de sources anthropiques chez le Goéland argenté (L. argentatus) pendant la saison de reproduction dans les deux plus grandes colonies de la baie de Fundy, au Canada, qui sont situées à 36 km l'une de l'autre. Nous avons déployé des enregistreurs GPS pour quantifier l'ensemble des déplacements spatiotemporels, et pris des échantillons de sang entier et de plumes pour faire l'analyse des isotopes stables δ13C et δ15N afin d'estimer la composition du régime alimentaire pendant les étapes d'incubation et d'élevage des poussins. Nos résultats indiquent qu'il y a une ségrégation spatiale dans les zones d'alimentation utilisées par les goélands des deux colonies. Tous les goélands dépendaient d'une variété de ressources alimentaires anthropiques, certains individus se nourrissant principalement des produits d'activités de pêcheries (c.-à-d. aux quais municipaux actifs, aux usines de transformation des poissons, aux bassins d'aquaculture) et aux élevages de visons (Neovison vison). Les dépotoirs n'étaient pas une source importante de nourriture pendant la saison de reproduction.

Our study provides valuable information about the relative reliance of gulls on anthropogenic food subsidies, providing insight into how changing industry practices may affect patterns in nesting and foraging by gulls in the region.
RÉSUMÉ
Les goélands (Larus spp.) sont décrits comme des mangeurs généralistes et opportunistes qui font preuve d'une grande souplesse dans l'utilisation de leur habitat. Malgré un certain avantage procuré par la modification des paysages, de nombreuses populations de Larus ont diminué dans l'est de l'Amérique du Nord depuis les années 1990. La principale hypothèse derrière cette diminution à grande échelle serait la baisse de la disponibilité générale de nourriture, en particulier de rejets de pêche d'origine anthropique et de déchets d'origine humaine, les industries et les villes ayant amélioré leurs pratiques de gestion. Cependant, il est difficile de quantifier la proportion totale du régime alimentaire des goélands fournie par l'homme pour tester cette hypothèse, car de nombreuses proies communes peuvent provenir à la fois de sources anthropiques ou non anthropiques. Notre objectif était de calculer la proportion du régime alimentaire provenant de sources anthropiques chez le Goéland argenté (L. argentatus) pendant la saison de reproduction dans les deux plus grandes colonies de la baie de Fundy, au Canada, qui sont situées à 36 km l'une de l'autre. Nous avons déployé des enregistreurs GPS pour quantifier l'ensemble des déplacements spatiotemporels, et pris des échantillons de sang entier et de plumes pour faire l'analyse des isotopes stables δ13C et δ15N afin d'estimer la composition du régime alimentaire pendant les étapes d'incubation et d'élevage des poussins. Nos résultats indiquent qu'il y a une ségrégation spatiale dans les zones d'alimentation utilisées par les goélands des deux colonies. Tous les goélands dépendaient d'une variété de ressources alimentaires anthropiques, certains individus se nourrissant principalement des produits d'activités de pêcheries (c.-à-d. aux quais municipaux actifs, aux usines de transformation des poissons, aux bassins d'aquaculture) et aux élevages de visons (Neovison vison). Les dépotoirs n'étaient pas une source importante de nourriture pendant la saison de reproduction.

Agriculture affects biodiversity on a global scale and especially in the Neotropics, leading to land-management challenges in which native wildlife is forced to interact with high-contrast landscape matrices. Further, the direct and indirect effects of hurricanes impacting native habitat in human-modified landscapes increases reliance on agricultural areas and high-contrast matrices. To understand how avian communities in a human-modified landscape respond to hurricane disturbance, we evaluated post-hurricane trends in species richness, density, structure, and functional and taxonomic composition in avian communities at tropical dry forest and in three agricultural habitats using point-count surveys. We compared our results to a similar study that took place years before the hurricanes in the study area. Similar to pre-hurricane trends, tropical dry forest provided key habitat for endemic species relative to agricultural areas, and tree orchards continued to serve as key secondary habitat for a high species richness and community evenness. However, tree orchards, along with cattle pastures and crop fields, failed to serve as successful buffers of hurricane disturbance by supporting half the estimated bird density of tropical dry forest. Cattle pasture and crop fields were both relatively species poor and had low community evenness compared to tropical dry forest and tree orchards after the hurricanes. Tropical dry forest had distinct species and feeding guild compositions compared to the agricultural habitats. All habitat types after the hurricanes had higher numbers of granivores and a reduction of carnivores compared to pre-hurricane levels. Land management in the study landscape needs to incorporate strategies that raise the hurricane resilience of agricultural areas while providing resources to support higher species richness and density in agricultural systems. Such strategies include the preservation of native trees and shrubs and allowing for the natural succession of habitat in unused areas in tree orchards, cattle pasture, and crop fields.
RÉSUMÉ
L'agriculture affecte la biodiversité à l'échelle mondiale et en particulier dans les régions néotropicales, ce qui aboutit à des difficultés en termes de gestion des terres sur lesquelles la faune native est obligée d'interagir avec des modèles de paysages hautement contrastés. En outre, les effets directs et indirects des ouragans sur l'habitat natif dans les paysages modifiés par l'homme augmentent la dépendance vis-à-vis des zones agricoles et des modèles fortement contrastés. Pour comprendre comment les populations aviaires dans un paysage modifié par l'homme réagissent aux perturbations engendrées par les ouragans, nous avons évalué les tendances post-ouragan en matière de richesse des espèces, de densité, de structure et de composition fonctionnelle et taxonomique des populations aviaires dans une forêt tropicale sèche et dans trois habitats agricoles en utilisant des enquêtes de dénombrement. Nous avons comparé nos résultats à ceux d'une étude similaire réalisée quelques années avant les ouragans dans la zone examinée. Tout comme les tendances pré-ouragan, la forêt tropicale sèche offrait un habitat essentiel aux espèces endémiques par rapport aux zones agricoles et trois vergers ont continué à servir d'habitat secondaire clé pour favoriser une grande richesse des espèces et l'égalité des communautés. Toutefois, les vergers, de même que les pâturages et les zones de récolte, ne constituaient pas des tampons efficaces contre les perturbations engendrées par les ouragans : ils n'ont préservé que la moitié de la densité aviaire estimée dans la forêt tropicale sèche. Suite aux ouragans, les pâturages et les champs cultivés étaient tous deux relativement pauvres en espèces et présentaient une faible égalité des communautés par rapport à la forêt tropicale sèche et aux vergers. La forêt tropicale sèche présentait des compositions d'espèces et de groupes trophiques distinctes par rapport aux habitats agricoles. Après les ouragans, tous les types d'habitat présentaient des nombres plus élevés de granivores et une réduction des carnivores par rapport aux niveaux antérieurs aux ouragans. La gestion des terres dans le paysage étudié doit intégrer des stratégies qui augmenteront la résilience des terres agricoles aux ouragans tout en fournissant des ressources aptes à soutenir une richesse et une densité accrues des espèces dans les systèmes agricoles. Ces stratégies comprennent la préservation des arbres et buissons natifs et une succession naturelle des habitats dans les zones inutilisées dans les vergers, les pâturages et les cultures.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art9/ACE-ECO-2021-1920.pdf,ace-eco.org,saltator,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.4898778409868,,262

While genetic approaches have played an important role in the development of chicken stocks, little is known about chicken epigenetics.

While overall DNA methylation distribution was similar to mammals, sperm DNA appeared hypomethylated, which correlates with the absence of the DNMT3L cofactor in the chicken genome. Additional analysis revealed the presence of low-methylated regions, which are conserved gene regulatory elements that show tissue-specific methylation patterns.

Reactive personality types are therefore predicted to make fewer mistakes in cognitive tasks, especially in tests of inhibitory control and reversal learning that require individuals to adjust behavioral routines. However, empirical evidence for this is mixed, and work relating cognition to a broader set of phenotypic traits has been called for. Here, using the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), we relate performance in a cognitive assay, the detour-reaching task, to differences in personality, while controlling for putative confounding factors (including sex, breath rate, body size, and mass). Contrary to theoretical predictions, we found that proactive individuals, rather than reactive, made fewer mistakes in the detour-reaching task. We used body size and mass as proxies for condition, but neither predicted personality type or cognitive performance, thus providing no support for the hypothesis that condition dependence mediates the association between proactive personality and detour-reaching performance. This work adds to a growing number of studies contributing conflicting findings on how animal personality relates to cognitive performance, which, together, appear to require novel theory and more nuanced predictions. Significance statement Theory predicts that reactive personality types (i.e., slower-acting and more attentive individuals) should perform better on cognitive tasks that involve inhibiting a response to an irrelevant stimulus to reach food (inhibitory control). Tests of this hypothesis have generated contradictory results and studies that account for confounding factors are needed. We quantified performance in an inhibitory control assay among common waxbills (Estrilda astrild), while controlling for the largest set of confounding factors to date. Contrary to predictions, waxbills with a reactive personality made more mistakes in the cognitive assay.

Studying the effects of urbanization on native wildlife presents an opportunity for us to learn how to design anthropogenic habitats that can best support wildlife and humans alike. In order to explore which types of suburban development best support bird diversity, a network of 16 bird feeders was installed across a university campus to compare bird diversity and community composition at locations varying in land covers such as natural forest, lawn, plantings, pavement, and buildings. Birds were observed at all feeder stations over three seasons and mist-nets were used to capture and band birds during the summer. Bird species richness, diversity, and invasive species dominance varied significantly across the feeder station sites, with higher diversity in less urbanized locations with larger areas of natural forest. Invasive House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) dominated the most urban sites and were associated with larger areas of buildings and herbaceous plantings. However, when sites with natural forest were removed from the analysis, the area of trees planted over lawn was associated with higher diversity, indicating that an increase in tree cover can support diversity in a completely developed landscape. Midscale suburban developments typically feature lawns, pavement, and landscaped plantings, but our results indicate that replacing lawns with trees, or better yet, restored forest patches, may allow us to preserve and even increase the biodiversity of our rapidly multiplying suburban landscapes.
RÉSUMÉ
L'examen des effets de l'urbanisation sur la faune indigène nous permet de concevoir des aménagements anthropiques meilleurs pour la cohabitation de la faune et de l'homme. Afin d'explorer quel type de milieu périurbain contribuait le plus à la diversité des oiseaux, nous avons installé un réseau de seize mangeoires d'oiseaux sur un campus universitaire pour comparer la diversité et la composition des communautés aviaires dans des lieux d'affectation diverse, comme la forêt naturelle, les pelouses, les plantations, les zones pavées ou bâties. Nous avons observé des oiseaux à toutes les stations d'alimentation durant trois saisons, et avons utilisé des filets japonais pour leur capture et leur baguage pendant l'été. Le nombre et la diversité des espèces d'oiseaux et la prédominance des espèces envahissantes ont varié significativement selon le lieu des stations : la diversité la plus élevée a été observée dans les lieux moins urbanisés, là où les zones de forêt naturelle étaient plus grandes. Les Moineaux domestiques (Passer domesticus), espèce envahissante, dominaient dans les sites les plus urbanisés et étaient associés avec les zones bâties et de plantations d'herbacées les plus grandes. Toutefois, lorsque nous retirions des analyses les sites comportant des forêts naturelles, les parterres de plantation d'arbres sur pelouse présentaient des diversités plus élevées, indiquant qu'une hausse du couvert forestier permet d'obtenir une diversité d'oiseaux dans un paysage entièrement aménagé. Les aménagements périurbains de taille moyenne comportent typiquement des pelouses, des zones pavées et des aménagements paysagers; or, nos résultats indiquent que le remplacement des pelouses par des arbres, ou encore mieux, la restauration des îlots de forêt, nous permet de conserver et même d'augmenter la biodiversité dans nos paysages périurbains qui se multiplient rapidement.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art2/ACE-ECO-2019-1408.pdf,ace-eco.org,junco,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.5417143039477,"['ou', 'passer domesticus']",1024

The heart is a proxy for the cardiopulmonary system, and the metabolic substrate utilization in the myocardium is also under the strong selective pressure of chronically hypoxic and hypothermic environments. However, little information is available on the physiological adjustments in relation to metabolic substrate utilization in the myocardium for coping with high-altitude environments. We compared the metabolic enzyme activities, including hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), citrate synthase (CS), carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT-1), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK), and metabolic substrate contents including glucose (Glu), triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) in the myocardium of a typical human commensal species, Eurasian Tree Sparrows (Passer montanus) between the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (the QTP, 3230 m) and low altitude population (Shijiazhuang, 80 m), and between sexes. Among the seven metabolic enzymes and three substrates investigated, we identified no significant differences in PK, CPT-1, HK, CS, LDH, and CK activities and TG content of the myocardium between high and low altitude populations. However, the QTP sparrows had significantly lower Glu content and PFK activities but higher FFA content relative to their lowland counterparts. In addition, male sparrows had higher myocardial HK and CS activities relative to females, independent of altitude.

Analyzing these characteristics together, we can reveal the potential capabilities of this biomechanical node as a whole. Such a complex analysis of the hyoid apparatus of the Old World suboscine passerine birds (Eurylaimides) is presented in this paper. For the birds of each family (Pittidae, Eurylaimidae, and Philepittidae), a functional interpretation of the detected morphological features is proposed (Part 1). Their tongues are highly mobile, this being necessary for performing a variety of specific tasks for each group. The pittas’ tongue is adapted to fast wide-amplitude movements, and it helps in controlling the object at any point of their relatively long and narrow beak. The fleshy tongue of carnivorous broadbills (Eurylaiminae and Smithornithinae) and Pseudocalyptomeninae performs complex manipulations with various objects in its wide bulky beak. The hyoid apparatus of the frugivorous broadbills (Calyptomeninae) helps to mash soft fruits and to push large and hard fruits inside the pharynx. The jaw apparatus of the asities (Philepittidae) is generally adapted to feeding on relatively small berries, which these birds can squash, using a specific wide platform at the base of the tongue.

Amidst heroic hunting narratives and picturesque descriptions of local fauna and flora, stands out a curious episode in which Wallace describes adopting a baby orangutan, whose mother he had killed. Wallace, a British naturalist and collector, cultivated an affectionate relationship with the orphaned orangutan, often referring to her as his “baby.” This paper examines how the orangutan was transformed from being a moving target for museum display, to a beloved companion but also a scientific specimen. In this process, Wallace redesigned his colonial bungalow to a space that combined domestic settings with engineered nature-like environments, a familiar construction in later primate research. I use Wallace’s adoption episode to discuss how affect and care were interwoven into the exploitative relations of British naturalists and physiologists and the animals they studied. The account of Wallace’s idiosyncratic relationship with the orangutan is augmented with additional documentation of the close relationships of scientists with research animals, staged as familial kinship. The emergence of the “laboratory pet” demonstrates how the production of knowledge, the sharing of households, and human-animal emotional ties were interwoven in early biomedical research.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10739-020-09611-8.pdf,link.springer.com,wallace,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.5682057934781,,604

Wetlands are essential for many animal and plant species. However, many of these ecosystems are being degraded. Wetland degradation affects the habitat of certain groups of species such as waterfowl, which use these environments at different stages of their life cycle. In this study, we assessed the quality of man-made wetlands, i.e., mine tailing ponds, in comparison to beaver ponds, which are natural wetlands used by waterfowl. We conducted repeated surveys of breeding waterfowl species present on 12 mining ponds and 38 beaver ponds in boreal western Quebec, Canada. We also conducted brood surveys and considered environmental variables at the sites that could affect their occupancy. Conditions at the mining ponds appear to be as favorable for the establishment of breeding waterfowl as those observed in beaver ponds. Using site occupancy models, we found that five out of the six species studied were as likely to occupy and breed in mining ponds as in beaver ponds: Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Wigeon (Mareca americana), Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca), and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus). Both adults and broods of Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) were more likely to use mining ponds than beaver ponds, but we did not find a direct relationship between goldeneye occupancy and environmental variables at our sites. Overall, the results of our study suggest that mining ponds have the potential to be managed for waterfowl and used by this group during the breeding season. However, further studies are required to assess the long-term effects of mining ponds on wildlife, particularly regarding contaminants such as heavy metals likely present at such sites.
RESUME_
Les milieux humides sont essentiels pour de nombreuses espèces animales et végétales. Cependant, la dégradation d'un grand nombre de ces écosystèmes est en cours. La dégradation des milieux humides affecte l'habitat de certains groupes d'espèces, comme la sauvagine, qui utilisent ces milieux à différentes étapes de leur cycle de vie. Dans la présente étude, nous avons évalué la qualité de milieux humides artificiels, c'est-à-dire des bassins de résidus miniers, par rapport à la qualité d'étangs de castors, qui sont des milieux humides naturels utilisés par la sauvagine. Nous avons effectué des relevés d'espèces de sauvagine nicheuses présentes sur 12 bassins miniers et 38 étangs de castors dans la région boréale de l'Ouest du Québec, au Canada. Nous avons également mené des relevés de couvées et examiné les variables environnementales des sites qui pourraient affecter leur occupation. Les conditions des bassins miniers semblent être aussi favorables à l'établissement de la sauvagine que celles observées dans les étangs de castors. À l'aide de modèles d'occupation des sites, nous avons constaté que cinq des six espèces étudiées étaient aussi susceptibles d'occuper les bassins miniers et de s'y reproduire que les étangs de castors : le Canard colvert (Anas platyrhynchos), le Fuligule à collier (Aythya collaris), le Canard d'Amérique (Mareca americana), la Sarcelle d'hiver (Anas crecca) et le Harle couronné (Lophodytes cucullatus). Les adultes et les couvées du Garrot à oeil d'or (Bucephala clangula) étaient plus susceptibles d'utiliser les bassins miniers que les étangs de castors, mais nous n'avons pas trouvé de relation directe entre l'occupation par les garrots et les variables environnementales de nos sites. Dans l'ensemble, les résultats de notre étude laissent croire que les bassins miniers ont le potentiel d'être gérés pour la sauvagine et utilisés par ce groupe pendant la saison de reproduction. Cependant, d'autres études sont nécessaires pour évaluer les effets à long terme des bassins miniers sur la faune, en particulier en ce qui a trait aux contaminants, tels que les métaux lourds probablement présents à ces sites.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art24/ACE-ECO-2021-2003.pdf,ace-eco.org,gadwall,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.5888575991314,"['mallard', 'anas platyrhynchos', 'teal', 'anas crecca', 'american wigeon', 'hooded merganser', 'bucephala clangula', 'goldeneye', ""sarcelle d'hiver"", 'common goldeneye', 'mareca americana', 'canard colvert', 'aythya collaris', 'lophodytes cucullatus']",170

Geneticists investigate anatomical characters, never anatomical constructions, which are capable of reorganization when the biological-morphological equilibrium of the organism has been disturbed. The anatomy of Opisthocomus cristatus and Stringops habroptilus demonstrate that three successive disturbances in the bio-morphological equilibrium are reacted to purposively by anatomical reconstruction. These reactions are no accidental mutations, but are anatomical reactions, related to, and affecting, the organism as a whole. In sharp contrast to such anatomical reaction, resulting, during phylogeny, in reorganization, are the “technics” [i.e., mechanistic bases] of individual development. The hereditary process is, like every physiological or embryological process, a fixed mechanism, which remains constant until an active reaction leads to reconstruction and at the same time an appropriate change of the mechanisms. The remolding of species is therefore no passive, “technical” process, but a creative act of the organisms themselves.

Defining and delineating populations of interest and identifying the drivers that affect those populations present the greatest current challenges. This is because migratory birds may be affected by many population-limiting processes at different stages of their annual life cycles. These factors are often hierarchically structured and can influence populations at the local, regional, or continental scales. Some of the challenges associated with delineating populations and identifying population drivers can be addressed via the plethora of sampling and analytic methods available to examine population change over time. Choosing the proper analytic methods depends on the goals of the study and the nature of the data such as single or multiple populations, repeated occurrence or count-based surveys, or demographic rates. Recent advances in hierarchical and integrated population models make these analytic approaches some of the most promising avenues for the development of future methods. However, these tools require large data sets, and acquiring sufficient data on bird populations and potential explanatory variables is difficult in the boreal forest. If the current challenges to monitoring birds in the boreal forest are to be overcome, serious effort should be dedicated to integrating existing data and making them accessible. Enhancing survey effort through multispecies surveys will also play an important role. Implementing spatially balanced sampling plans with a rotating panel design could balance the trade-offs between spatial versus temporal replication at an affordable cost. Improving the accessibility of environmental covariates that are spatially and temporally explicit would also enable development of mechanistic population models that improve our understanding of migratory bird population dynamics. Finally, given that long-term monitoring programs can take many decades before delivering reliable population trends and that organizational priorities often change over time, we suggest that collaborative efforts will help ensure the long-term survival of new monitoring programs.

They were engraved, painted, and embellished with ivory, precious metals and faience fittings. They have been found primarily in elite funerary contexts from Mesopotamia and the Levant to the wider Mediterranean throughout the region’s Bronze and Iron Ages (third-first millennia BCE). Most scholarship has assessed their iconography to determine craftsman origin, equating decorative style with cultural identity. This is tenuous at best, given how readily motifs can be copied or adapted, and especially challenging for periods in which artisans were reliant on royal/elite patronage and known to migrate between regions, as during these eras. Furthermore, the full extent of the roles of non-elites in the production and distribution of these elite artefacts has never been considered directly. Thus, the role these luxuries played as social actors across a spectrum of society has been overlooked. It is this aspect that the present work addresses. It does so by building upon a recently concluded study that has used isotopic analyses and scanning electron microscopy to assess where and how eggs were acquired in the ancient Mediterranean and the working techniques used to decorate them. The results allow us to consider the role these objects played as social actors upon more than just their elite consumers. This suggests that, as scholars, we must adopt different questions, methodologies, and thus perspectives, to recognise the wider social effects of luxury material culture and its impact upon diverse groups and individuals beyond wealthy consumers.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00541-8.pdf,nature.com,autruche,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.6128166549667,,625

Characterizing genetic architecture provides insight into the complexity of a given phenotype and, potentially, the role of the phenotype in evolutionary processes like speciation. We use genome sequences to investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in redpoll finches (Acanthis spp.). We demonstrate that variation in redpoll phenotype is broadly controlled by a ~55-Mb chromosomal inversion. Within this inversion, we find multiple candidate genes related to melanogenesis, carotenoid coloration, and bill shape, suggesting the inversion acts as a supergene controlling multiple linked traits. A latitudinal gradient in ecotype distribution suggests supergene driven variation in color and bill morphology are likely under environmental selection, maintaining supergene haplotypes as a balanced polymorphism. Our results provide a mechanism for the maintenance of ecotype variation in redpolls despite a genome largely homogenized by gene flow.

Nests were mostly placed on dead trees or dead branches of trees, primarily on red alder (Alnus rubra) of smaller size than those reported for natural sites. The average productivity of the nests was 2.0 young and most nests (13/14) fledged at least one young. Annual adult survivorship varied across years, but the average (83.0%) was higher than what has been reported for nearby natural sites of the Pacific Northwest.

Herein, we tested for macroevolutionary signatures of selection in these gene families within and among all three major clades of birds (Paleognathae, Galloanserae, and Neoaves). We characterized evolutionary relationships of representative immune genes (Mhc1 and Tlr2b) and a control gene (ubiquitin, Ubb), using a relatively large and phylogenetically diverse set of species with complete coding sequences (34 orthologous loci for Mhc1, 29 for Tlr2b, and 37 for Ubb). Episodic positive diversifying selection was found in the gene-wide phylogenies of the two immune genes, as well as at specific sites within each gene (8.5% of codon sites in Mhc1 and 2.7% in Tlr2b), but not in the control gene (Ubb). We found 20% of lineages under episodic diversifying selection in Mhc1 versus 9.1% in Tlr2b. For Mhc1, selection was relaxed in the Galloanserae and intensified in the Neoaves relative to the other clades, but no differences were detected among clades in the Tlr2b gene. In summary, we provide evidence of episodic positive diversifying selection in key immune genes and demonstrate differential strengths of selection within Class Aves, with the adaptive gene showing an increased divergence and evolutionary rate over the innate gene, contributing to the growing understanding of vertebrate immune gene evolution.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10709-019-00081-3.pdf,link.springer.com,bananaquit,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.6849143539382,,874

Recent findings The pre-screening of HIV-infected patients in resource-poor countries with the lateral flow cryptococcal antigen assay could prevent C-IRIS. Delaying ART by 4 weeks is associated with improved survival and recommended by guidelines; this approach remains controversial in wealthier areas as there is limited data. A 5-flucytosine-based combination regimen and avoidance of corticosteroids on initial treatment improve cryptococcus clearance from cerebrospinal fluid. New monoclonal antibodies and kinase inhibitors that alter the immune system, such as ibrutinib and ruxolitinib, have been associated with cryptococcosis. Summary It is important to recognize that restoration of the immune system, regardless of the host, can lead to C-IRIS. Prevention of C-IRIS by pre-screening patients, delaying antiretroviral therapy, and using a 5-flucytosine backbone regimen are important in the management of meningitis.

The Bay of Fundy, Canada is a critical migratory stopover for Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) during fall migration. Recent ecological changes combined with range-wide population declines indicate that a re-evaluation of habitat use and regional fidelity is required. The Bay of Fundy is divided into three regions, each of which contains multiple foraging and roost sites. In this study, we examined local movement and regional fidelity within and between years using radio-telemetry and field-readable markers. We deployed 194 radio-transmitters and 2295 field-readable flags on Semipalmated Sandpipers during migration in 2013-2014, and resighted these birds, along with additional birds flagged in 2012, between 2013 and 2016. Radio-tracked birds used on average 1.3 to 4.1 foraging and roost sites per day, with most making multiple daily movements, but only 2% made permanent moves between geographically distant regions within the bay during stopover. Additionally, 97% of birds returned to their original region in subsequent years. The use of multiple sites suggests Semipalmated Sandpipers are capable of adapting to dynamic conditions in the Bay of Fundy on a local scale, but the high regional fidelity suggests that their ability to adapt to changes occurring at a regional scale may be limited. Uncertainty about the capability of Semipalmated Sandpipers to flexibly move among different regions of the Bay of Fundy supports the need for conservation at both the site and regional level.
RÉSUMÉ
La baie de Fundy, au Canada, représente une halte essentielle pour les Bécasseaux semipalmés (Calidris pusilla) durant la migration automnale. Une réévaluation de l'utilisation de l'habitat et de la fidélité régionale est nécessaire en raison de changements écologiques récents couplés aux diminutions de population à grande échelle. La baie de Fundy se divise en trois régions, chacune comptant de nombreux sites d'alimentation et de repos. Nous avons examiné les déplacements locaux et la fidélité régionale des bécasseaux au cours d'une même année et entre les années, au moyen de la radiotélémétrie et de marqueurs lisibles à distance sur le terrain. Nous avons posé 194 émetteurs radio et 2 295 marqueurs sur des Bécasseaux semipalmés durant les migrations de 2013 et 2014, et avons réobservé ces oiseaux de 2013 à 2016, en plus d'autres oiseaux munis de marqueurs en 2012. Les oiseaux suivis par radio ont utilisé de 1,3 à 4,1 sites d'alimentation et de repos en moyenne par jour, la plupart se déplaçant plusieurs fois quotidiennement, tandis que 2 % seulement se sont déplacés de façon permanente entre des régions distantes dans la baie en cours de halte. De plus, 97 % des oiseaux sont retournés dans leur région d'origine dans les années subséquentes.

Among fishes, Triportheidae stands out as the only family where almost all species have a homeologous ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes system. While the Z chromosome is typically conserved, the W is always smaller, with variations in size and morphology between species. Here, we report an analysis of the satellitome of Triportheus auritus (TauSat) by integrating genomic and chromosomal data, with a special focus on the highly abundant and female-biased satDNAs. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary trajectories of the ZW sex chromosomes in the Triportheidae family by mapping satDNAs in selected representative species of this family. The satellitome of T. auritus comprised 53 satDNA families of which 24 were also hybridized by FISH. Most satDNAs differed significantly between sexes, with 19 out of 24 being enriched on the W chromosome of T. auritus. The number of satDNAs hybridized into the W chromosomes of T. signatus and T. albus decreased to six and four, respectively, in accordance with the size of their W chromosomes. No TauSat probes produced FISH signals on the chromosomes of Agoniates halecinus. Despite its apparent conservation, our results indicate that each species differs in the satDNA accumulation on the Z chromosome. Minimum spanning trees (MSTs), generated for three satDNA families with different patterns of FISH mapping data, revealed different homogenization rates between the Z and W chromosomes. These results were linked to different levels of recombination between them. The most abundant satDNA family (TauSat01) was exclusively hybridized in the centromeres of all 52 chromosomes of T. auritus, and its putative role in the centromere evolution was also highlighted.

Aerial insectivore populations have declined significantly across Canada for the last fifty years. Although there are several suggested drivers of these population declines, including agricultural intensification, not all species show similar spatiotemporal population trends. Therefore, comparing interspecies differences in breeding productivity on the breeding grounds is vital to understand what is driving population variation among aerial insectivores. We examined breeding productivity and phenology in relation to habitat, weather, and insect availability for two co-occurring swallow species, Tree Swallow (Tachinyeta bicolor;−2.79 regional annual trend index) and Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica;−3.33 regional annual trend index) over four years on the southern coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found only minor interspecies differences in breeding productivity (brood size, fledge success) comparing first broods, although the Barn Swallow is double-brooded, suggesting higher potential productivity than in the Tree Swallow. However, Tree Swallows had larger clutches, earlier lay dates, and more rapid cumulative laying than Barn Swallows. There was little effect of habitat on breeding productivity or phenology for either species, and we found no significant difference in total insect abundance between crop and pasture habitats. Overall, our study suggests there is little interspecies variation in breeding productivity for first broods between these co-occurring aerial insectivores in British Columbia. Given the higher propensity for double brooding and no differences in brood size or fledging success, Barn Swallows in this region may, in fact, have higher annual productivity than Tree Swallows, despite a more steeply declining regional population trend, suggesting that declines are caused by factors operating outside the breeding grounds or during post-breeding.
RÉSUMÉ
Les populations d'insectivores aériens ont diminué de façon importante au Canada au cours des cinquante dernières années. Bien que plusieurs facteurs soient avancés pour expliquer ces baisses de population, notamment l'intensification de l'agriculture, les espèces ne présentent pas toutes des tendances spatio-temporelles similaires. Par conséquent, il est essentiel de comparer les différences entre les espèces en matière de productivité sur les lieux de nidification si on veut comprendre ce qui fait varier les populations d'insectivores aériens. Nous avons examiné la productivité et la phénologie en fonction de l'habitat, des conditions météorologiques et de la disponibilité d'insectes pour deux espèces d'hirondelles cooccurrentes, l'Hirondelle bicolore (Tachinyeta bicolor; indice de tendance annuelle régionale de -2,79) et l'Hirondelle rustique (Hirundo rustica; indice de tendance annuelle régionale de -3,33) pendant quatre ans sur la côte sud de la Colombie-Britannique, au Canada. Nous n'avons trouvé que des différences mineures entre ces deux espèces quant à la productivité (taille de la ponte, succès des jeunes à l'envol) en comparant la première ponte; or, l'Hirondelle rustique procède à une seconde ponte, ce qui laisse croire qu'elle aurait une productivité potentielle plus élevée que celle de l'Hirondelle bicolore. Toutefois, les Hirondelles bicolores avaient de plus grandes couvées, des dates de ponte plus hâtives et une ponte cumulative plus rapide que les Hirondelles rustiques. L'habitat a eu peu d'effets sur la productivité ou la phénologie de l'une ou l'autre des espèces, et nous n'avons trouvé aucune différence significative dans l'abondance totale d'insectes entre les milieux cultivés et les pâturages. Dans l'ensemble, nos résultats indiquent qu'il y a peu de variation interspécifique en matière de productivité pour la première ponte entre ces insectivores aériens cooccurrents en Colombie-Britannique. Étant donné leur propension plus élevée de faire une seconde ponte et l'absence de différences dans la taille de ponte ou le succès des jeunes à l'envol, il est possible que les Hirondelles rustiques de cette région aient, en fait, une productivité annuelle plus élevée que celle des Hirondelles bicolores, malgré une tendance régionale à la baisse plus marquée, résultat qui laisse supposer que les baisses sont causées par des facteurs agissant ailleurs que sur les aires de nidification ou pendant la période suivant la reproduction.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art27/ACE-ECO-2021-2001.pdf,ace-eco.org,salvadori,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8036094076613,"['hirundo rustica', 'ou', 'swallow', 'barn swallow', 'tree swallow']",140

How animals choose habitats during periods of inactivity, such as roosting or resting, is an often overlooked aspect of habitat preference that can differ significantly from how habitats are selected during active periods. Eastern Whip-poor-wills (Antrostomus vociferus) are migratory nocturnal aerial insectivores that breed throughout eastern North America. In Canada, Whip-poor-will populations have declined by over 30% in the past 20 years, and a comprehensive understanding of their diurnal and nocturnal habitat selection is required for developing effective conservation management strategies. From 447 radio-telemetry locations of 12 female and 32 male adult Whip-poor-wills radio-tracked over three breeding seasons (2018-2020), we used resource selection functions to assess habitat preference of Whip-poor-wills in the northern portion of their breeding range within Torrance Barrens Dark-Sky Preserve, central Ontario. Locations were taken both at night when individuals were primarily active and during the day when they were roosting. During both day and night, Whip-poor-wills used deciduous forest and shrubland more often than expected based on availability, while they avoided open water and wetlands. At night, Whip-poor-wills preferred to use mixed forest and rock barrens, while there was no difference between use and availability of these land cover types during the day. Our results suggest that shrubland and deciduous forest are important as both foraging and roosting habitat for Whip-poor-wills in this population, while rock barrens and mixed forest are important for foraging. While landscapes dominated by rock barrens interspersed with patches of shrubland and deciduous and mixed forests are uncommon, they could play an important role in the persistence of declining Whip-poor-will populations, particularly in the northern part of their breeding range. Conservation efforts for northern breeding Whip-poor-wills should focus on surveying and protecting similar rock barrens landscapes and those with a comparable patchwork of land cover features.
RÉSUMÉ
La manière dont les animaux choisissent leurs habitats pendant les périodes d'inactivité, par exemple pour la nidification ou le repos, est un aspect souvent négligé de la préférence d'habitat qui peut varier considérablement selon la manière dont les habitats sont choisis pendant les périodes actives. L'engoulevent bois-pourri (Antrostomus vociferus) est un insectivore aérien nocturne migrateur qui se reproduit dans tout l'est de l'Amérique du Nord. Au Canada, les populations d'engoulevents bois-pourri ont décliné de plus de 30 % au cours des 20 dernières années et une compréhension complète de la sélection de leur habitat diurne et nocturne est nécessaire pour développer des stratégies efficaces de gestion de la conservation. À partir de 447 localisations par radio-télémétrie de 12 engoulevents bois-pourri femelles et 32 mâles adultes pendant trois saisons de reproduction (2018-2020), nous avons utilisé des fonctions de sélection des ressources pour évaluer la préférence des engoulevents en termes d'habitat dans la partie nord de leur zone de reproduction au sein de la réserve naturelle de Torrance Barrens Dark-Sky, au centre de l'Ontario. Les localisations ont été mesurées à la fois de nuit, lorsque les individus sont plutôt actifs, et pendant la journée, lorsqu'ils étaient dans leur nid. De jour comme de nuit, les engoulevents fréquentaient des forêts d'arbres à feuillage caduc et des broussailles plus fréquemment que prévu en fonction de leur disponibilité, alors qu'ils évitaient les plans d'eau et les marécages. De nuit, les engoulevents privilégiaient la forêt mixte et les landes rocheuses, alors qu'il n'existait pas de différence entre l'utilisation et la disponibilité de ces types d'abris terrestres pendant la journée. Nos résultats suggèrent que les broussailles et les forêts de feuillus sont importants en tant qu'habitats de nourriture et de nidification pour les engoulevents de cette population, alors que les landes rocheuses et les forêts mixtes sont des sites de nourriture majeurs. Même si les paysages dominés par des landes rocheuses entrecoupées de broussailles et de forêts de feuillus et mixtes sont peu fréquents, ils pourraient jouer un rôle important dans la persistance des populations déclinantes d'engoulevents, en particulier dans la partie nord de leur zone de reproduction. Les efforts de conservation des engoulevents reproducteurs dans le nord devraient se concentrer sur l'observation et la protection de paysages similaires de landes rocheuses et de ceux qui présentent des caractéristiques végétales comparables.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art14/ACE-ECO-2021-1929.pdf,ace-eco.org,whip-poor-will,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8257199184525,"['antrostomus vociferus', 'ou']",231

Documenting and interpreting trends in the abundance and distribution of bird populations is critical to monitoring their status and setting conservation priorities. This process requires standardized monitoring and robust analytical techniques, which can resolve trends at spatial scales of management interest while disentangling the influence that various data collection protocols can have on the interpretation of results. We used a 19-year citizen-science-collected dataset (2001–2019), the Nocturnal Owl Survey, to assess abundance trends in Barred Owl (Strix varia), Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), and Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) at both fine and broad-scales. To achieve this, we used a spatially explicit modeling approach that facilitates the borrowing of information across spatial boundaries, allowing for more robust trend estimates at finer spatial scales. Further, we assessed the potential influence of the call-playback protocol on trend estimates. At fine spatial scales, we found that a data collection protocol that includes call playbacks provided more precise results to assess relative changes in abundance (i.e., reduced uncertainty). At broader spatial scales, trend estimates were unaffected by data collection methodology (i.e., silent listening versus call playback). Specifically, at the scale of the region or province, we found that populations of focal owl species in the Maritimes of Canada have remained stable over the past 19 years. However, at finer scales, trends are more variable and may create opportunities to test alternative hypotheses about drivers of population change and the effects of management actions at scales amenable to conservation action. The statistical analyses are anticipated to form a national, publicly accessible framework for status assessments of owls in Canada and will provide resource managers and researchers a base from which to evaluate the influence of land management and conservation practices on owl populations across the nation.
RÉSUMÉ
La documentation et l'interprétation de la tendance en matière d'abondance et de répartition des populations d'oiseaux sont essentielles pour qu'on puisse surveiller leur statut et établir les priorités de conservation. Ce processus requiert des techniques de suivis normalisés et d'analyses robustes, qui peuvent résoudre les tendances à des échelles spatiales d'intérêt pour la gestion tout en examinant l'influence que les divers protocoles de collecte de données peuvent avoir sur l'interprétation des résultats. Nous avons utilisé un ensemble de données collectées par des citoyens depuis 19 ans (2001-2019), l'Inventaire des Strigidés nocturnes, pour évaluer la tendance de l'abondance de la Chouette rayée (Strix varia), de la Petite Nyctale (Aegolius acadicus) et du Grand-duc d'Amérique (Bubo virginianus) à des échelles fines et larges. Pour ce faire, nous avons utilisé une approche de modélisation spatialement explicite qui facilite l'emprunt d'informations à travers les frontières spatiales, permettant d'obtenir des estimations de tendance plus robustes à des échelles spatiales plus fines. De plus, nous avons évalué l'influence potentielle du protocole relatif à l'utilisation d'enregistrements sonores sur les estimations des tendances. À des échelles spatiales fines, nous avons constaté qu'un protocole de collecte de données qui inclut l'utilisation d'enregistrements sonores fournissait des résultats plus précis pour évaluer les changements relatifs dans l'abondance (c.-à-d. une incertitude réduite). À des échelles spatiales plus larges, les estimations des tendances n'ont pas été influencées par la méthodologie de collecte de données (c.-à-d. l'écoute silencieuse par rapport à l'utilisation d'enregistrements). Plus précisément, à l'échelle de la région ou de la province, nous avons constaté que les populations des espèces de Strigidés examinées sont restées stables au cours des 19 dernières années. Cependant, à des échelles plus fines, les tendances sont plus variables et peuvent représenter des occasions de tester d'autres hypothèses quant aux facteurs de changement des populations et aux effets des mesures de gestion à des échelles se prêtant à des mesures de conservation. Les analyses statistiques devraient former un cadre national accessible au public dans le cadre de l'évaluation de la situation des Strigidés au Canada et fourniront aux gestionnaires de ressources et aux chercheurs une base à partir de laquelle ils pourront évaluer l'influence des pratiques de gestion et de conservation sur les populations de Strigidés dans tout le pays.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art12/ACE-ECO-2021-2075.pdf,ace-eco.org,rayée,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8258365835417,"['strix varia', 'aegolius acadicus', 'bubo virginianus', 'great horned owl', 'ou', 'barred owl']",50

Bird surveys have relied upon acoustic cues for species identification for decades; however, errors in detection and identification can lead to misclassification of the site occupancy state. Although significant improvements have been made to correct for false negative (FN) error, less work has been done on identifying and modeling false positive (FP) error. In our online survey we found misidentification can occur even among highly skilled observers, thus methods are required to correct for FP error. In this study we model both FP and FN error in bird surveys using a multiple detection state model (MDSM), and found that modeling both types of error lowered occupancy (ψ) relative to the FN only models in 84% of the observation data sets, and this suggests significant bias in ψ can occur in studies that do not correct for both FN and FP error. In our autonomous recording units (ARU) data we had two detection states, “confirmed” and “unconfirmed,” where confirmation was based on agreement of two interpreters, and through simulation evaluated performance of the MDSM using this type of ARU data. We found that MDSM can effectively correct for both FN and FP error across a broad of range of survey observation rates and detection rates (d) and is appropriate for data using “confirmed detections.” We developed a binary classification model to assign risk of bias to field observation sets based on survey and model parameters, and found that lower risk of bias cannot be predicted by a single variable or value, but rather occurs under certain combinations of low naïve occupancy rate (< ~0.2), detection rate (< ~0.2), number of confirmed recordings (< ~20) and high FP rate (> ~0.07). Our approach to interpreting ARU data along with our analysis guidelines should help reduce potential inflation of ψ resulting from FP error.
RÉSUMÉ
La détection de vocalisations pour identifier les espèces est intrinsèque aux relevés d'oiseaux depuis des décennies; toutefois, les erreurs de détection et d'identification peuvent mener à des erreurs quant à l'occupation d'un site. Bien que d'importantes améliorations ont été proposées pour corriger les erreurs liées aux faux négatifs (FN), moins de travaux ont porté sur la détermination et la modulation des erreurs liées aux faux positifs (FP). Dans notre enquête en ligne, nous avons constaté que les mauvaises identifications peuvent même être le fait d'observateurs chevronnés, de sorte qu'il est nécessaire d'élaborer des méthodes pour corriger les erreurs liées aux FP. Dans la présente étude, nous avons modélisé les erreurs liées aux FP et aux FN de relevés d'oiseaux au moyen d'un modèle à états multi-détections (MEMD). Nous avons trouvé que la modélisation des deux types d'erreurs diminuait le taux d'occupation (ψ) comparativement aux modèles ne tenant compte que des FN dans 84 % des jeux de données d'observations, ce qui indique que ψ peut comporter un biais important dans le cas d'études ne corrigeant pas les deux types d'erreurs. Nos données tirées d'enregistreurs autonomes (EA) présentaient deux états de détection, « confirmé » et « non-confirmé »; la confirmation reposait sur l'accord de deux interprètes et la simulation de performance du MEMD utilisant ce type de données issues d'EA. Nous avons constaté que le MEMD peut corriger correctement les erreurs liées aux FN et aux FP dans une grande étendue de taux d'observation et de taux de détection (d), et est approprié pour les données présentant des « détections confirmées ». Nous avons élaboré un modèle de classification binaire assignant le risque de biais de jeux d'observations fondé sur les paramètres de relevé et de modèle, et avons trouvé qu'un faible risque de biais ne peut pas être prédit par une seule variable ou valeur, mais se présente plutôt sous certaines combinaisons faiblement naïves du taux d'occupation (< ~0,2), du taux de détection (< ~0,2), du nombre de mentions confirmées (< ~20) et du taux élevé de FP (> ~0,07). Notre approche d'interprétation de données d'EA couplée à nos recommandations d'analyse devraient contribuer à réduire l'inflation possible de ψ résultant d'erreurs liées aux FP.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art1/ACE-ECO-2019-1374.pdf,ace-eco.org,laurel-pigeon,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8269196996181,['ou'],1024

One such restored wetland complex in the Illinois River Valley, the Emiquon Preserve, is isolated from most flooding events of the Illinois River allowing the growth of persistent emergent vegetation that was quickly colonized by breeding wetland birds. We examined nest occurrence and variables influencing site selection, nest success, and changes in nest density across stages of the wetland succession cycle. We located 327 nests from nine species of wetland birds (American Bittern,Botaurus lentiginosus; American Coot,Fulica americana; Black-crowned Night-Heron,Nycticorax nycticorax; Black-necked Stilt,Himantopus mexicanus; Common Gallinule,Gallinula galeata; Green Heron,Butorides virescens; Least Bittern,Ixobrychus exilis; Pied-billed Grebe,Podilymbus podiceps; Sora,Porzana carolina) during 2013–2019. Common Gallinules were more likely to nest in persistent emergent vegetation than other cover types. American Coots and Least Bitterns selected nest sites based on water depth. Black-necked Stilt and Black-crowned Night-Heron nests were less successful in deeper water. Black-necked Stilt, Black-crowned Night-Heron, and Common Gallinule nests were less successful with later initiation dates. Nest density did not vary between persistent emergent and hemi-marsh cover types. Across 2013–2019 we estimated an average of 372 nests/year for six marsh-nesting bird species at Emiquon, including two state-endangered (Common Gallinule and Black-crowned Night-Heron) and one state-threatened (Least Bittern). Wetlands restored from agricultural fields can quickly provide critical breeding habitat for marsh-nesting birds of conservation concern, although continued management is needed to provide resources to maintain persistent emergent vegetation communities as individual marshes transition through the marsh cycle.

Understanding spatial and temporal movement patterns of migratory birds throughout the annual cycle can help identify potential population threats. The behavior and habitat use of birds during migration and stopover periods is particularly understudied in many species. In this study, we used high spatial resolution archival GPS tags to track Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) from one eastern (New Hampshire) and two western (Alaska and Alberta) breeding populations across the annual cycle. We sought to determine: 1) migratory connectivity of the three distinct populations; 2) migratory phenology, behavior, and time spent during each phase of the annual cycle; and 3) habitat use of individuals throughout the nonbreeding period. We retrieved 7 tags from 30 tagged individuals following 1-year deployments. We found that four Alberta individuals overwintered in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, two Alaska individuals overwintered in either the Great Plains or the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, and the single New Hampshire individual overwintered on the Southeastern Coastal Plain. Length of annual cycle stages varied among individuals, with the combined migratory periods occupying between 12% and 48% of the annual cycle. Stopover behavior was also widely variable, as minimum convex polygons of stopovers ranged from < 1 hectare to 505 km² and stopover durations ranged from 1 to 35 days (n = 40 stopovers). Birds predominantly used woody wetlands and emergent marsh during the nonbreeding period, but habitat use differed between roosting and foraging. Marshes were used more for nocturnal roosting, whereas woody wetlands were used for diurnal foraging. Our results can help efforts to conserve this declining species by targeting regions and habitats at specific times of year for management during the nonbreeding period. In particular, the large amount of time spent during migration periods suggests conservation efforts in stopover regions are just as important as those on the wintering grounds.
RÉSUMÉ
La compréhension des habitudes de déplacements spatiaux et temporels des oiseaux migrateurs tout au long du cycle annuel peut permettre d'identifier les menaces potentielles pour ces populations. L'utilisation du comportement et de l'habitat des oiseaux pendant les périodes de migration et d'escales est particulièrement sous-étudiée chez de nombreuses espèces. Dans cette étude, nous avons utilisé des balises GPS d'archivage à haute résolution spatiale pour suivre les quiscales rouilleux (Euphagus carolinus) d'une population de reproduction de l'est du pays (New Hampshire) et de deux populations de l'ouest (Alaska et Alberta) tout au long du cycle annuel. Nous cherchions à déterminer : 1) la connectivité migratoire des trois populations distinctes ; 2) la phénologie migratoire, le comportement et le temps consacré à chaque phase du cycle annuel ; et 3) l'utilisation de l'habitat par les individus tout au long de la période hors reproduction. Nous avons récupéré 7 balises sur 30 individus bagués à la suite de déploiements d'un an. Nous avons constaté que quatre individus de l'Alberta avaient passé l'hiver dans la vallée alluviale du Mississippi, que deux individus de l'Alaska avaient séjourné dans les grandes plaines de la vallée alluviale du Mississippi et qu'un seul individu du New Hampshire avait passé l'hiver dans la plaine côtière du sud-est. La durée des différentes phases du cycle annuel variait selon les individus, les périodes migratoires combinées représentant entre 12 % et 48 % du cycle annuel. Le comportement en termes d'escales était également très variable, car les polygones convexes minimum des escales variaient de < 1 hectare à 505 km² et la durée des escales variait de 1 à 35 jours (n = 40 escales). Les oiseaux choisissaient en majorité des régions marécageuses boisées et des marais émergents au cours de la période hors-reproduction, mais l'utilisation de l'habitat variait entre la nidification et la recherche de nourriture. Les marais étaient davantage utilisés pour la nidification nocturne, alors que les marécages boisés étaient privilégiés pour la recherche de nourriture diurne. Nos résultats peuvent favoriser les efforts de préservation de cette espèce en déclin, en ciblant les régions et les habitats au cours de périodes spécifiques de l'année pour la gestion hors de la période de reproduction. Plus précisément, les longues périodes de migration suggèrent que les efforts de conservation dans les régions d'escale sont tout aussi importants que ceux qui sont réalisés sur les territoires d'hivernage.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art20/ACE-ECO-2021-1871.pdf,ace-eco.org,courol,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8290849791453,['euphagus carolinus'],323

Fire regimes of forests, i.e., time interval, frequency, extent, and severity of fire events, influence structural changes in the vegetation, and thus shape the composition of avian communities. We studied the diversity of avian guilds in sites with different fire regimes (unburned, burned 2002, burned 2015, and burned 2002 and 2015), testing both the ""intermediate disturbance"" and ""vertical vegetation structure"" hypotheses, in globally threatened temperate forests in Chile. From 2016 to 2018, we quantified habitat attributes (160 plots) and estimated avian richness and density (160 point counts). The site that was burned once in 2015 showed the highest density of standing dead trees at 96.5% higher than the unburned/control site, whereas the site that burned twice showed the lowest density of live trees, lowest average diameter at breast height of trees (DBH), and smallest volume of coarse woody debris. Overall, we recorded 35 avian species with the highest richness (n = 24 species) in the site that was burned once in 2002. We found that, 16 years after a site was burned, the avian community composition became relatively similar to the unburned site. The density of most avian guilds decreased in burned sites but granivores, shrub users, and migrants showed positive responses. Understory users, foliage users, and resident species showed negative responses to burned sites. These responses were strongly related to fire-driven changes in habitat attributes, supporting both of our tested hypotheses. Given that increasing levels of disturbance from fire are anticipated, future management of temperate forest biodiversity should consider that specific species and guilds will depend on remnant habitat attributes in burned sites.

Les utilisateurs du sous-étage, les utilisateurs du feuillage et les espèces résidentes ont réagi négativement aux sites brûlés. Ces réactions étaient fortement liées aux changements des attributs de l'habitat induits par le feu, résultat qui soutient nos deux hypothèses.

Cyanogenic lepidopterans such as Heliconius butterflies and Zygaena moths are rejected by vertebrate predators, but the role played by these compounds in predator deterrence is poorly explored. Here I report tests undertook with captive domestic chicks (Gallus gallus) to evaluate the effect of cyanoglucosides, linamarin and prunasin and their breakdown products. In insects as well as plants, cyanoglucosides are enzymatically broken down when the tissue is disrupted as in the case of a predator attack. The aliphatic linamarin releases cyanide and acetone upon breakdown, while prunasin is an aromatic cyanoglucoside that releases cyanide and benzaldehyde. Using concentrations that mimicked the concentration of Heliconius butterflies, I ran trials with naïve chicks by offering palatable prey laced with chemicals resulting from cyanoglucoside breakdown. I categorized prey acceptance and compared the behavior of the predators towards test and control prey. Prey coated with cyanide and benzaldehyde were rejected by the birds, while acetone elicited some avoidance behavior. Intact cyanoglucosides were not rejected by the predators presumably because of fast ingestion time or lack of enzymes to break it down. Rejection of cyanide-laced prey confirms the protective nature of cyanoglucosides against a vertebrate predator. The rejection of the pungent but not toxic benzaldehyde and the potential effect of acetone suggest that cyanoglucosides could be detected via smell as well by taste. These results provide support for cyanoglucosides as defensive chemicals of aposematic lepidopterans and related arthropods.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00049-020-00304-6.pdf,link.springer.com,jacamar,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-10.8426116802007,['gallus gallus'],775

Because birds are frequently detected by sound, autonomous audio recorders (called automated recording units or ARUs) are now an established tool in addition to in-person observations for monitoring the status and trends of bird populations. ARUs have been evaluated and applied during breeding seasons, and to monitor the nocturnal flight calls of migrating birds. However, birds behave differently during migration than during the breeding season. Here we present a method for using ARUs to monitor land birds during the migration period in remote habitats. We conducted in-person point counts next to continuously recording ARUs, and compared estimates of the number of species detected and focal species relative abundance from point counts and ARUs. We used a desk-based audio bird survey method for processing audio recordings, which does not require automated species identification algorithms. We tested two methods of using extended duration ARU recording: surveying consecutive minutes and surveying randomly selected minutes. Desk-based surveys using randomly selected minutes from extended duration ARU recordings performed similarly to point counts, and better than desk-based surveys using consecutive minutes from ARU recordings. Surveying randomly selected minutes from ARUs provided estimates of relative abundance that were strongly correlated with estimates from point counts and successfully showed the increase in abundance associated with migration timing. Randomly selected minutes also provided estimates of the number of species present that were comparable to estimates from point counts. Our results suggest that ARUs are an effective way to track migration timing and intensity in remote or seasonally inaccessible habitat during spring migration. Additional testing is needed to determine the efficacy of our methods during fall migration, and at more southerly latitudes. We recommend that desk-based surveys use randomly sampled minutes from extended duration ARU recordings, rather than using consecutive minutes from recordings. Our methods can be immediately applied by researchers with the skills to conduct point counts, with no additional expertise necessary in automated species identification algorithms.
RÉSUMÉ
Les oiseaux sont fréquemment détectables par le son : c'est pourquoi l'utilisation d'enregistreurs audio autonomes (appelés unités d'enregistrement automatisées, ou ARU) est de plus en plus courante, en plus des observations réalisées en personne pour surveiller le statut et les tendances des populations d'oiseaux. Les ARU ont été évaluées et installées au cours des saisons de reproduction et en vue de surveiller les cris nocturnes des oiseaux migrateurs en vol. Toutefois, le comportement des oiseaux est différent pendant la migration et pendant la saison de reproduction. Nous présentons ici une méthode d'utilisation des ARU pour surveiller les oiseaux terrestres au cours de la période de migration dans les habitats éloignés. Nous avons réalisé des comptes ponctuels en personne en plus des ARU qui enregistraient en continu et comparé les estimations du nombre d'espèces détectées et de l'abondance relative des espèces focales effectuées à partir des décomptes en personne et des ARU. Nous avons utilisé une méthode d'enquête audio de bureau pour traiter les enregistrements audio. Cette méthode ne requiert pas d'algorithme d'identification automatique des espèces. Nous avons testé deux méthodes d'utilisation d'enregistrements par ARU à durée prolongée : l'observation pendant plusieurs minutes consécutives et l'observation au cours de minutes sélectionnées de manière aléatoire. Les enquêtes de bureau utilisant des minutes sélectionnées de manière aléatoire à partir des enregistrements d'ARU de longue durée ont donné des résultats similaires aux décomptes et supérieurs aux enquêtes de bureau utilisant des minutes consécutives d'enregistrement des ARU. L'étude de minutes à sélection aléatoire à partir des ARU a fourni des estimations de l'abondance relative qui étaient étroitement corrélées aux estimations produites par les décomptes et a démontré l'augmentation de l'abondance associée aux dates de migration. Les minutes sélectionnées de manière aléatoire ont également fourni des estimations du nombre d'espèces présentes qui étaient comparables à celles obtenues par les décomptes effectués en personne. Nos résultats suggèrent que les ARU sont un moyen efficace de suivre les dates et l'intensité de la migration dans les habitats éloignés ou inaccessibles pendant la migration de printemps. Des tests supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour déterminer l'efficacité de nos méthodes au cours de la prochaine migration d'automne et à des latitudes plus méridionales. Nous recommandons que les études de bureau utilisent des minutes échantillonnées de manière aléatoire extraites des enregistrements des ARU, plutôt que des minutes d'enregistrement consécutives. Nos méthodes peuvent être appliquées immédiatement par les chercheurs qui possèdent les compétences requises pour réaliser des décomptes, sans disposer d'une expertise supplémentaire des algorithmes automatisés d'identification des espèces.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art21/ACE-ECO-2021-1885.pdf,ace-eco.org,satrapa,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-10.89135059017542,['ou'],323

Intersexual differences in habitat choice can arise if males and females differ in morphology, physiology, niche partitioning, or resource use, and can be influenced by variation in habitat structure, quality, and management. To better understand such intersexual differences, we studied habitat choice in female Great Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), a long-distance migrant flagship species of lowland Palearctic reed (Phragmites australis) habitats. We compared wing length, a widely used proxy for individual quality in passerines, of females nesting in six types of differently managed reed habitats. Our dataset on 391 females nesting in 32 sites over 10 years showed that wing length was significantly greater in mining ponds and medium-sized canals than on large canals. Wing length was negatively related to water level fluctuation and females showed strong philopatry to the habitat type in which they were first captured. In comparison to our previous study on male habitat choice, this study found differences in habitat choice between the sexes. Although long-winged individuals in both sexes preferred habitats with stable water and avoided small canals, longer-winged males preferred large canals with little or no management, whereas long-winged females preferred medium-sized canals with some management. Although these results provide some support for intersexual niche segregation, it is also possible that long-winged females avoid large canals, in which nest parasitism by Cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) is frequent, and/or prefer managed, sparse reed beds with better maneuverability for foraging. Our studies suggest that males may primarily choose habitats with abundant old reed and singing perches, whereas females are less sensitive to environmental variation and may choose nest sites based on male quality or territory quality. For conservation, our studies imply that the maintenance of stable water levels, a low intensity of management and the elimination of Cuckoo perches are likely to benefit both long-winged males and females.
RÉSUMÉ
Des différences dans la sélection d'habitat liées au sexe peuvent s'observer si les mâles et les femelles diffèrent en termes de morphologie, de physiologie, de différenciation de niche ou d'utilisation des ressources, et peuvent être influencées par la variation de structure, de qualité et de l'aménagement de l'habitat. Pour mieux comprendre ce type de différences intersexuelles, nous avons étudié la sélection d'habitat chez la femelle Rousserolle turdoïde (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), espèce-phare migratrice de longue distance occupant des milieux paléarctiques de basses terres dominées par le roseau (Phragmites australis). Nous avons comparé la longueur de l'aile, un indicateur très utilisé pour attester de la qualité individuelle des passereaux, de femelles nichant dans six types de milieux de roseaux aménagés de façon différente. Notre jeu de données, comportant 391 femelles nicheuses à 32 sites sur une période de 10 ans, a révélé que la longueur de l'aile était considérablement plus grande chez les femelles occupant les étangs miniers et les canaux de largeur moyenne, comparativement à celles occupant les grands canaux. La longueur de l'aile était négativement liée aux fluctuations du niveau d'eau et les femelles ont montré une forte philopatrie au type de milieu dans lequel elles avaient été capturées la première fois. Comparativement à notre étude précédente portant sur la sélection d'habitat chez les mâles, la présente étude a fait état de différences selon le sexe dans la sélection d'habitat. Même si les individus aux longues ailes chez les deux sexes ont préféré les milieux montrant un niveau d'eau stable et évité les petits canaux, les mâles aux ailes plus longues ont préféré les grands canaux peu ou non aménagés, tandis que les femelles aux ailes longues ont préféré les moyens canaux un peu aménagés. Bien que ces résultats corroborent jusqu'à un certain point une différenciation de niche fondée sur le sexe, il est aussi possible que les femelles aux longues ailes évitent les canaux larges, dans lesquels le parasitisme de nids par les coucous (Cuculus canorus) est fréquent, et/ou préfèrent les îlots de roseaux épars et aménagés, qui permettent de manoeuvrer plus facilement pour chercher la nourriture. Nos études laissent croire que les mâles sélectionnent peut-être d'abord les milieux comprenant de nombreux vieux roseaux et des perchoirs desquels chanter, tandis que les femelles sont moins sensibles aux variations environnementales et sélectionnent sans doute des sites de nidification en fonction de la qualité du mâle ou du territoire. Aux fins de conservation, nous études indiquent que le maintien d'un niveau d'eau stable, l'aménagement à faible intensité et l'élimination des perchoirs de coucous sont vraisemblablement susceptibles de profiter tant aux mâles qu'aux femelles aux longues ailes.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol15/iss1/art22/ACE-ECO-2020-1571.pdf,ace-eco.org,oenanthe,2022-04-20,0,0,1,1,1,-10.89488919213493,"['acrocephalus arundinaceus', 'cuculus canorus', 'cuckoo', 'ou', 'rousserolle turdoïde']",688

Pneumatic foramina are present on the external surface of the bone and are reliable indicators of post-cranial skeletal pneumatization present in Pterosauria, Eusauropoda, and Neotheropoda. Here, we carried out a qualitative analysis of the position, size and number of pneumatic foramina of the cervical and thoracic/dorsal vertebrae of pterosaurs and birds, as they have the potential to challenge hypotheses about the emergence and evolution of the respiratory trait in these groups. We also discussed differences between pneumatic and vascular foramina for identification purposes. Besides phylogenetic representativeness, the pterosaur taxonomic sampling considered the preservation of specimens and, for birds, their life habit, as this relates to the level of pneumatization. Pneumatic foramina on the lateral faces of the centrum of the mid-cervical vertebrae of pterosaurs and birds differ in position and size, and those adjacent to the neural canal additionally differ in number. The avian posterior cervical vertebrae show a higher number of pneumatic foramina in comparison to their mid-cervicals, while the opposite is true for pterosaurs, suggesting differences in the cervical air sac of these clades. Pneumatic foramina were found at the base of the transverse processes of the notarial vertebrae of birds, while they were absent from some of the pterosaurs analyzed here, revealing the presence of a pneumatic hiatus in the vertebral column that might be explained due to the distance of this structure to the cervical air sac. These findings indicate that, although the overall skeletal pneumatization of pterosaurs and birds present deep homologies, some pneumatic features occurred convergently because variation in the number of pneumatic foramina along the vertebral column is related to the position of the air sacs in pterosaurs and birds and/or the habit of each species. There is an evident reduction of the pneumatic foramina in birds that have aquatic foraging and an increase in the ones which perform static soaring. Although we did not find any external anatomical difference between pneumatic and vascular foramina, we observed that vascular foramina occur at specific sites and thus identification on the basis of location is reliable.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224165&type=printable,journals.plos.org,leonado,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-10.912799403775,,908

Here we report an analysis of the co-evolution of translatomes and transcriptomes using ribosome-profiling and matched RNA-sequencing data for three organs (brain, liver and testis) in five mammals (human, macaque, mouse, opossum and platypus) and a bird (chicken). Our within-species analyses reveal that translational regulation is widespread in the different organs, in particular across the spermatogenic cell types of the testis. The between-species divergence in gene expression is around 20% lower at the translatome layer than at the transcriptome layer owing to extensive buffering between the expression layers, which especially preserved old, essential and housekeeping genes. Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global dosage reductions during the evolution of sex chromosomes and the effects of meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis. Despite the overall prevalence of buffering, some genes evolved faster at the translatome layer—potentially indicating adaptive changes in expression; testis tissue shows the highest fraction of such genes. Further analyses incorporating mass spectrometry proteomics data establish that the co-evolution of transcriptomes and translatomes is reflected at the proteome layer. Together, our work uncovers co-evolutionary patterns and associated selective forces across the expression layers, and provides a resource for understanding their interplay in mammalian organs.

Nest box supplementation is a widely used technique to aid in the conservation of cavity nesting bird species. However, the criteria to choose the best location for nest boxes has seldom considered the likely exposure of cavity-users to parasites. Birds host an impressive diversity of ectoparasites that may have detrimental effects on their fitness. Here we focus on the ectoparasite infracommunity of a secondary cavity nesting bird species, the European Roller (Coracias garrulus), breeding in nest boxes in a semiarid environment. During three breeding seasons, we examined the composition and abundance of parasites at the nest level and explored their spatial structure and the effect of nest-site type, breeding phenology, and host number (brood mass) on the variability of the infracommunity. Nest location (nest boxes on trees vs nests on cliffs and human constructions) contributed the most to explain differences in prevalence and abundance of the various ectoparasite species during the three years. Host breeding phenology consistently affected the abundance of the most prevalent and abundant ectoparasite (Carnus hemapterus) and also the abundance of biting midges and blackflies, but only during some years. Host brood mass had no significant influence on any ectoparasite. Neither the occurrence nor the abundance of the infracommunity of parasites had a significant spatial structure. This study, performed at the host population scale, reveals that the socioenvironmental characteristics resulting from the selection of nest-site microhabitat explain most of the variation of the ectoparasite infracommunity. Accordingly, nest boxes for vulnerable species should be placed with solid knowledge of the effect of such features.
RÉSUMÉ
On installe très souvent des nichoirs pour aider à la conservation des espèces d'oiseaux cavicoles. Toutefois, les critères pour l'emplacement des nichoirs ont rarement pris en compte l'exposition probable des utilisateurs de cavités aux parasites. Les oiseaux sont les hôtes d'une diversité impressionnante d'ectoparasites qui peuvent avoir des effets néfastes sur leur santé. Dans la présente étude, nous examinons l'infracommunauté d'ectoparasites d'une espèce d'oiseaux nicheurs utilisatrice secondaire de cavités, le Rollier d'Europe (Coracias garrulus), qui niche dans des nichoirs en milieu semi-aride. Durant trois saisons de reproduction, nous avons étudié la composition et l'abondance des parasites à l'échelle du nid et exploré leur structure spatiale ainsi que l'effet du type de site de nidification, de la phénologie de reproduction et du nombre d'hôtes (masse des couvées) sur la variabilité de l'infracommunauté. L'emplacement des nids (nichoirs sur les arbres par rapport aux nids sur les falaises et les constructions humaines) a contribué le plus à expliquer les différences de prévalence et d'abondance des diverses espèces d'ectoparasites au cours des trois années. La phénologie de reproduction de l'hôte a eu un effet systématique sur l'abondance de l'ectoparasite le plus fréquent et le plus abondant (Carnus hemapterus), de même que sur celle des moucherons piqueurs et des mouches noires, mais seulement lors de certaines années.

The habits and ontogenetic changes of locomotion in animals can, thus, be explored by assessing skeletal mechanical performance. In this study, we investigated the growing femoral mechanical performance in an ontogenetic series of Cabot’s Tragopans (Tragopan caboti) and Pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Micro-computed tomography-based finite element analysis was conducted to evaluate the stress, strain, and strain energy density (SED) of femora under axial and radial loading. Femora deflected medio-laterally and dorso-ventrally under axial and radial loading, respectively. Femora deformed and tensed more severely under radial loading than axial loading. In adult individuals, Cabot’s Tragopans had lower strain and SED than pigeons. During ontogeny, the strain and SED of pigeons decreased sharply, while Cabot’s Tragopans showed moderately change. The structural properties of hatchling pigeons are more robust than those of hatchling Cabot’s Tragopans. Limb postures have dominant effect on skeletal deformation. The erect posture is preferred by large mammals and birds to achieve a high safety factor of bones during locomotion. Adult Cabot’s Tragopans have stronger femora than pigeons, reflecting a better bone adaption to the terrestrial locomotion of the studied pheasant species. Changes in strain and SED during growth reflect the marked difference in locomotor ability between precocial and altricial hatchlings. The femora of hatchling Cabot’s Tragopans were built with better energy efficiency than deformation resistance, enabling optimized mechanical performance. In contrast, although weak in mechanical function at the time of hatching, pigeon femora were suggested to be established with a more mature structural design as a prerequisite for rapid growth.

Because of this, we emphasize the need for regional planning to increase the structural connectivity between fragments of mature native forests, to provide an opportunity for the persistence of Magellanic Woodpeckers in this region.

In this paper, I claim that a Reichenbach-inspired, ‘layered’ view of coordination provides us with an effective tool to systematically analyse some epistemic and conceptual intricacies resulting from a widespread theorising strategy in evolutionary biology, recently discussed by Okasha (2018) as ‘endogenization’. First, I argue that endogenization is a form of extension of natural selection theory that comprises three stages: quasi-axiomatisation, functional extension, and semantic extension. Then, I argue that the functional extension of one core principle of natural selection theory, namely, the principle of heritability, requires the semantic extension of the concept of inheritance. This is because the semantic extension of ‘inheritance’ is necessary to establish a novel form of coordination between the principle of heritability and the extended domain of phenomena that it is supposed to represent. Finally, I suggest that—despite the current lack of consensus on the right semantic extension of ‘inheritance’—we can fruitfully understand the reconceptualization of ‘inheritance’ provided by niche construction theorists as the result of a novel form of coordination.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-021-03228-y.pdf,link.springer.com,reichenbach,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-11.0462894252154,,320

The main goal of this study was to describe F. tularensis strains circulating in Kazakhstan based on WGS data and develop a MLVA assay compatible with in vitro and in silico analysis. In vitro MLVA genotyping and WGS were performed for the vaccine strain and for 38 strains isolated in Kazakhstan from natural water bodies, ticks, rodents, carnivores, and from one migratory bird, an Isabellina wheatear captured in a rodent burrow. The two genotyping approaches were congruent and allowed to attribute all strains to two F. tularensis holarctica lineages, B.4 and B.12. The seven tandem repeats polymorphic in the investigated strain collection could be typed in a single multiplex PCR assay. Identical MLVA genotypes were produced by in vitro and in silico analysis, demonstrating full compatibility between the two approaches. The strains from Kazakhstan were compared to all publicly available WGS data of worldwide origin by whole genome SNP (wgSNP) analysis.

As urbanization continues to transform landscapes, it is imperative to find ways to conserve biodiversity within fragmented habitats. Forest interior dwelling birds are particularly vulnerable to development pressures because they require large tracts of forest to support their life cycles. Although Barred Owls (Strix varia) are frequently described as an obligate mature forest species, they have been found in urbanized landscapes. To determine if certain habitat characteristics, such as mature trees, facilitate the presence of Barred Owls in developed regions, we modeled Barred Owl occupancy probability along a development gradient in the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States. We surveyed for owls by broadcasting conspecific calls to solicit response and by passively recording at survey sites using autonomous recording units. Detection/nondetection data were collected during the breeding season and analyzed within an occupancy framework to investigate patterns of habitat association in our region, while allowing for imperfect detection of owls. Average tree height was the best predictor of Barred Owl occupancy across a development gradient, regardless of forest coverage. We did not find Barred Owl occupancy to decline with increasing impervious surface density. Our research implies that developed landscapes containing mature urban trees can support breeding populations of Barred Owls.
RÉSUMÉ
L'urbanisation transformant en continu les paysages, il est impératif de trouver des façons de conserver la biodiversité dans les milieux fragmentés. Les oiseaux qui fréquentent l'intérieur des forêts sont particulièrement vulnérables à l'étalement urbain parce qu'ils ont besoin de grands parterres forestiers durant leur cycle annuel. Bien que les Chouettes rayées (Strix varia) soient souvent décrites comme des espèces de forêts matures strictes, elles ont pourtant aussi été trouvées dans des paysages urbanisés. Afin de déterminer si certaines caractéristiques de l'habitat, tels que les arbres matures, facilitaient la présence de chouettes dans les régions urbanisées, nous avons modélisé la probabilité d'occurrence de cette espèce le long d'un gradient d'urbanisation dans la région du Piedmont dans le sud-est des États-Unis. Nous avons inventorié les chouettes en diffusant des enregistrements de chants de conspécifiques afin de susciter une réponse, et passivement, en enregistrant au moyen d'enregistreurs automatisés à des sites d'inventaire. Les données de détection/non-détection ont été récoltées durant la saison de nidification et analysées dans le contexte d'un modèle d'occurrence pour investiguer les tendances dans l'association espèce-habitat dans la région, tout en tenant compte de la détection incomplète des chouettes. La hauteur moyenne des arbres s'est avérée la variable la meilleure pour prédire la présence des Chouettes rayées le long d'un gradient d'urbanisation, peu importe le couvert forestier. Nous n'avons pas observé de diminutions dans la présence des chouettes avec l'augmentation de la densité de superficie imperméable.

In higher vertebrates, the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor gives rise to α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which are involved in numerous physiological aspects. Genetic defects in POMC are linked to metabolic disorders in humans and animals. In the present study, we undertook an evolutionary genetic approach complemented with biochemistry to investigate the functional consequences of genetic polymorphisms in the POMC system of free-living outbred barn owl species (family Tytonidae) at the molecular level. Our phylogenetic studies revealed a striking correlation between a loss-of-function H9P mutation in the β-MSH receptor-binding motif and an extension of a poly-serine stretch in γ3-MSH to ≥7 residues that arose in the barn owl group 6–8 MYA ago. We found that extension of the poly-serine stretches in the γ-MSH locus affects POMC precursor processing, increasing γ3-MSH production at the expense of γ2-MSH and resulting in an overall reduction of γ-MSH signaling, which may be part of a negative feedback mechanism. Extension of the γ3-MSH poly-serine stretches ≥7 further markedly increases peptide hormone stability in plasma, which is conserved in humans, and is likely relevant to its endocrine function. In sum, our phylogenetic analysis of POMC in wild living owls uncovered a H9P β-MSH mutation subsequent to serine extension in γ3-MSH to 7 residues, which was then followed by further serine extension.

Cue counting is a method developed for estimating vocally active wildlife density by dividing the density of cues (number of cues per unit area surveyed per unit time) by the average cue rate (ACR) at which individuals vocalize. It has been used successfully to estimate whale density using passive acoustic monitoring, but its efficacy has had limited testing in birds. We tested whether cue counting can be used to infer bird abundance using autonomous recording units and estimated the minimum effort required to obtain a reliable cue rate at individual and population levels. We recorded Dupont's Lark (Chersophilus duponti) vocalizations at 31 sites where traditional field censuses were also performed. We estimated the ACR using three methodologies: directional recordings, recordings from an online database of bird sounds (xeno-canto), and behavioral field studies. The ACRs estimated using directional recordings and behavioral field studies were similar, and bird numbers were over and underestimated by 0.8 and 10%, respectively (74–77% of the sampling sites were well estimated). However, the ACR estimated using xeno-canto recordings was much higher than those estimated using the other two methods, and bird numbers were underestimated by 41%. We also performed a cost-effectiveness assessment of the number of individuals and recording durations needed to optimize the estimation of a reliable ACR. We found that ACR estimates were more efficient if long (25 min) recordings were used when < 4 males were recorded, whereas 5-min recordings were more efficient for ≥ 20 males. We conclude that cue counting can be useful to infer bird density around recorders but requires an accurate measure of the ACR. Further research should evaluate the effectiveness of passive cue counting on a large number of species and under different circumstances.
RÉSUMÉ
Le comptage des détections est une méthode qui a été élaborée pour estimer la densité de la faune active vocalement en divisant la densité de détections (nombre de détections par unité de surface étudiée par unité de temps) par le taux moyen de détections (TMD) auquel les individus chantent ou crient. Cette méthode a été utilisée avec succès pour calculer la densité des baleines à l'aide d'un suivi sonore passif, mais son efficacité a peu été testée chez les oiseaux. Nous avons testé si le comptage des détections pouvait être utilisé pour déduire l'abondance des oiseaux en utilisant des enregistreurs automatisés et avons calculé l'effort minimum requis pour obtenir un taux de détections fiable au niveau des individus et des populations. Nous avons enregistré les manifestations sonores du Sirli de Dupont (Chersophilus duponti) sur 31 sites où des recensements traditionnels ont également été effectués. Nous avons calculé le TMD de trois façons : à partir d'enregistrements directionnels, d'enregistrements provenant d'une base de données de cris et de chants d'oiseaux accessible en ligne (xeno-canto) et d'études comportementales sur le terrain. Les TMD calculés à l'aide d'enregistrements directionnels et d'études comportementales étaient similaires, et le nombre d'oiseaux était surestimé et sous-estimé de 0,8 et 10 %, respectivement (la mesure de 74-77 % des sites d'échantillonnage était juste). Cependant, le TMD calculé à l'aide d'enregistrements de xeno-canto était beaucoup plus élevé que ceux obtenus au moyen des deux autres méthodes, et le nombre d'oiseaux était sous-estimé de 41 %. Nous avons également réalisé une évaluation coût-efficacité du nombre d'individus et des durées d'enregistrement nécessaires pour optimiser le calcul d'un TMD fiable. Nous avons constaté que la mesure du TMD était meilleure si des enregistrements longs (25 min) étaient utilisés lorsque < 4 mâles étaient enregistrés, tandis que des enregistrements de 5 min étaient plus efficaces pour ≥ 20 mâles. Nous concluons que le comptage des détections peut être utile pour calculer la densité d'oiseaux autour des enregistreurs, mais une mesure précise du TMD doit d'abord être effectuée. D'autres recherches devraient se pencher sur l'évaluation de l'efficacité du comptage passif des détections dans le cas d'un grand nombre d'espèces et dans différentes circonstances.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art11/ACE-ECO-2021-1801.pdf,ace-eco.org,whistling-thrush,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-11.1020316327219,"['ou', 'chersophilus duponti']",384

The employment of disguises—defined as altering one’s appearance for purposes of deceiving conspecifics or other animals—is noted for eight of the 10 societies, with their use occurring in contexts of hunting, religious or cult practices, and war or interpersonal violence. Most hunter-gatherer disguises demonstrated clear similarities to cases of visual deception found in other species, with the majority of examples fitting categories of animal mimicry, masquerading as plants, disruptive coloration (camouflage), or background matching (camouflage), while disguises unique to humans involved the impersonation of culture-specific “spirit-beings.” Clothing for modesty purposes (nine societies) and body armor (six societies) are also noted.

Several studies have shown that the Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is strongly favored by large-scale disturbances, including forest fires. However, natural disturbances have largely disappeared from European boreal forests because of modern forestry practices and fire suppression. We currently lack knowledge on the foraging activity and resource use of the Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker, especially in burned forests, and this restricts our ability to develop strategies for sustainable forest management and ecological restoration aiming at improving the situation of this woodpecker and associated species. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we studied the characteristics of selected foraging substrates and the foraging behavior of the Three-toed Woodpecker during the breeding season in unburned forests and forests that have been subjected to prescribed burning. We used instantaneous sampling during two consecutive springs (2016-2017), where we observed the woodpeckers’ foraging behavior during a total of 977 minutes in burned forest and 962 minutes in unburned forests. The preferred foraging substrate for Three-toed Woodpeckers in both burned and unburned forests can be characterized as freshly dead trees with a DBH > 15 cm. However, data on time spent foraging on different substrates suggest that also substrates in the 5-15 DBH range and living trees are important. Additionally, prescribed burnings led to less pronounced selection of tree species, which suggest that fire may reduce differences in abundance of saproxylic insect prey between tree species. This information on substrate selection and foraging time provide complementary knowledge and thus should be used simultaneously when management strategies for improved woodpecker habitat are developed. Our results suggest that both prescribed burning and protecting forests with high density and diversity of dead wood provides habitat opportunities for Three-toed Woodpeckers and using both in management may maximize conservation outcome.
RÉSUMÉ
Plusieurs études ont montré que le Pic tridactyle (Picoides tridactylus) profite des perturbations survenant sur de vastes étendues, dont les incendies de forêt. Toutefois, les perturbations naturelles n'existent presque plus dans les forêts boréales d'Europe en raison des pratiques forestières modernes et de la suppression des incendies de forêt. Le manque actuel de connaissances sur l'alimentation et l'utilisation des ressources par le Pic tridactyle, spécialement dans les forêts brûlées, restreint notre habilité à élaborer des stratégies d'aménagement durable des forêts et de restauration écologique visant à améliorer la situation de ce pic et d'autres espèces associées. Pour combler cette lacune, nous avons étudié les caractéristiques des substrats choisis pour l'alimentation et le comportement d'alimentation du Pic tridactyle durant la saison de nidification, dans des forêts non brûlées et des forêts ayant fait l'objet de brûlage dirigé. Nous avons échantillonné de façon instantanée durant deux printemps consécutifs (2016-2017), au cours desquels nous avons observé les pics s'alimenter durant 977 minutes en forêts brûlées et 962 minutes en forêts non brûlées. Le substrat favori des Pics tridactyles pour l'alimentation, tant en forêts brûlées que non brûlées, s'est révélé être des arbres fraîchement morts ayant un DHP > 15 cm. Cependant, selon le temps dédié par les pics pour s'alimenter sur les différents substrats, ceux compris dans la fourchette de DHP située entre 5 et 15, tout comme les arbres vivants, avaient aussi leur importance. De plus, dans le cas des feux dirigés, les pics ont été moins sélectifs dans leurs essences d'arbres, laissant croire que le feu pourrait réduire la variabilité de l'abondance des insectes saproxyliques qu'ils consomment entre les essences d'arbres. Ces résultats sur la sélection de substrats et le temps dédié à l'alimentation fournissent des connaissances complémentaires et devraient être considérés simultanément au moment d'élaborer des stratégies d'aménagement visant à améliorer l'habitat de ce pic.

Due to the large amounts of eggs released by the flatfish Solea senegalensis, during the spawning season, the hatching liquid properties and choriolysin-encoding genes were investigated in this species. A genomic analysis identified four putative genes referred to as SseHCEa, SseHCEb, SseLCE and SseHE. The phylogenetic analysis classified these paralogs into two clades, the clade I containing SseHCE paralogs and the clade II containing two well-supported subclades named as HE and LCE. The two SseHCE paralogs were intron-less and both genes were tandemly arrayed very close in the genome. The synteny and gene rearrangement identified in the flatfish lineage indicated that the duplication of these two paralogs occurred recently and they are under divergent evolution. The genes SseHE and SseLCE were structured in 8 exons and 7 introns and the synteny was conserved in teleosts. Expression studies confirmed that the four genes were expressed in the hatching gland cells and they migrate co-ordinately from the head to around the yolk sac close to the hatch with specific temporal and intensity expression profiles. Although the mRNA levels of the four genes peaked in the hours previous to larval hatching, the SseHCE and SseLCE paralogs kept a longer expression than SseHE after hatching. These expression patterns were consistent even when larvae were incubated at different temperatures that modified hatching times. The analysis of hatching-liquid using SDS-PAGE and zymography analyses of hatching liquid identified a major band of expected choriolysin size. The optimal pH for protease activity was 8.5 and inhibition assays using EDTA demonstrated that most of the activity in the hatching liquid was due to metalloproteases with Ca2+ ions acting as the most effective metal to restore the activity. All these data provide new clues about the choriolysin evolution and function in flatfish with impact in the aquaculture and the blue cosmetic industry.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225666&type=printable,journals.plos.org,manchado,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-11.1671571350929,,867

Understanding the transferability of ecological models from one area to another is important for the effective conservation of species of management concern, particularly when the ability to sample across multiple areas is limited. Two measures of transferability, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and threshold-specific classification accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), are often employed in assessing models of bird occurrence or resource selection. Although informative, these measures may have limited practical utility in guiding on-the-ground habitat management like forest thinning, which often relies on simple metrics such as tree diameter. We addressed this challenge in studying the occurrence of Pinyon Jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) nest locations in four piñon-juniper woodland sites in New Mexico, USA. Using generalized linear mixed models, we employed covariates describing woodland structure at several scales to discriminate nest from non-nest plots. We found fair transferability of model predictions between sites via AUC (mean = 0.71), fair threshold-specific specificity (mean = 67%), and poor threshold-specific sensitivity (mean = 42%). Under a hypothetical scenario of forest thinning, we employed a covariate predictive in models of each site, nest (or non-nest plot center) tree root crown diameter (RCD), to assess a management-practical measure of transferability. Using critical RCD values at which 75% of nest trees were retained, we found fair transferability between sites (MEAN = 70%), though we observed retention of nest trees as low as 21%. Average retention increased to 75% (minimum = 60%) when information from multiple sites was combined. This example illustrates that the application of information from one area to the management of another may be effective but may also result in loss of important habitat or other resources. We found that management of Pinyon Jay nesting habitat should proceed on a single-site basis when local nesting information is available. Caution should be exercised when prescribing management in locations where information on nesting is lacking, and information from as many nearby sites as possible should be employed.

They are currently threatened by illegal hunting, overgrazing, and invasive predators. Because their breeding area is intensely grazed by sheep and cows, we studied the interaction of sheldgeese flocks and breeding pairs with livestock in the Tierra del Fuego and Santa Cruz provinces in Patagonia, Argentina. We conducted road-based surveys of sheldgeese flocks and breeding pairs from spring 2013 to summer 2016 to explore sheldgeese behavior. In addition, we monitored Upland Goose nests using camera traps and estimated nest daily survival rates in nests unprotected and protected from livestock with an electric fence. Sheldgeese flocks and breeding pairs were more frequently sighted alone than associated with livestock. Also, when sheldgeese foraged alongside livestock, there were fewer individuals resting and these allocated more time to forage than in the absence of livestock. We did not observe lower individual vigilance in sheldgeese flocks sharing foraging patches with livestock. Nests protected by electric fences had higher daily survival rates than unprotected ones. Our results indicate that one important conservation action should be to identify areas that concentrate a great number of breeding pairs of sheldgeese, and protect them from livestock, mainly during the peak of the reproductive season.

The structure of the nouvelle is examined through a close reading of two key motifs: vines intertwined with roses, and flowing water. The different iterations of these motifs are interpreted as expressing the impossibility of recovering the symbolical and sentimental values that the author-narrator cherished in the past. This structure is identified as one of the factors that allowed Sylvie to be well received in neoclassical circles. It is suggested that this construction is also what caused Proust’s fascination with, and scepticism towards, the nouvelle. The article concludes that Sylvie should be considered a unique text which opens the way for a new type of writing, whilst also closing it down. The nouvelle’s referential logic is different from that of Romantic, neoclassical or realist works. Indeed, the reason why it cannot be taken as a model is that it presents the reader with a particular kind of réel, which is inseparable from the crisis of Romanticism.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11061-022-09727-8.pdf,link.springer.com,marbré,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-11.3283362504281,,28

Understanding what factors influence the occurrence and distribution across the landscape is necessary for species conservation and management. Distribution data for many owl species are inadequate because of their nocturnal behavior and cryptic nature. We examined the role of climate, land cover, and human disturbance in shaping spatial distribution of the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) and Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) in northern Alberta. Using autonomous recording units, we conducted passive acoustic surveys to detect owls of both species throughout Alberta’s boreal forest. We compiled data on environmental variables at each sample site corresponding to a local scale and at landscape scale. A boosted regression tree analysis identified average minimum winter temperature as the most important predictor of Boreal Owl distribution. Boreal Owls were more likely to be present in cool environments with cold winters, and a low percentage of grassland cover at the landscape scale. Cropland cover at the local scale was the most influential factor in the final distribution model for the Northern Saw-whet Owl, and they were more likely to be present in areas where cropland was interspersed with deciduous-dominated forests. Furthermore, these areas generally had cool summer temperatures and received less precipitation as snow. Linear features at the landscape scale negatively influenced distribution of Boreal Owls, but edges created by linear features at local scale positively influenced Northern Saw-whet Owl distribution. Our study provides new information about habitat use that can be applied in management and conservation of these two poorly studied species of owls.
RÉSUMÉ
Pour bien conserver et gérer les espèces, il faut comprendre quels facteurs agissent sur leur présence et leur répartition dans le paysage. Les données de répartition de nombreuses espèces de chouettes sont inadéquates en raison de leur comportement nocturne et de leur nature cryptique. Nous avons examiné le rôle du climat, de la composition du paysage et des perturbations d'origine humaine dans le façonnement de la répartition spatiale de la Nyctale de Tengmalm (Aegolius funereus) et de la Petite Nyctale (Aegolius acadicus) dans le nord de l'Alberta. Au moyen d'enregistreurs automatisés, nous avons effectué des relevés acoustiques passifs afin de détecter les individus des deux espèces de nyctales en forêt boréale albertaine. Nous avons compilé les valeurs de variables environnementales récoltées à chaque site d'échantillonnage aux échelles locale et du paysage. Une analyse de régression arborescente par entrée forcée a permis de déterminer que la température hivernale minimum moyenne était la valeur explicative la plus importante dans la répartition de la Nyctale de Tengmalm. Les Nyctales de Tengmalm étaient plus susceptibles d'être présentes dans des environnements frais aux hivers froids, et ayant une faible superficie de prairies à l'échelle du paysage. La superficie de terres cultivées à l'échelle locale était le facteur ayant le plus d'effet dans le modèle final de répartition pour la Petite Nyctale, et les individus étaient plus susceptibles d'être présents aux endroits où les terres cultivées voisinaient des forêts à dominance de feuillus. De plus, ces endroits avaient généralement des températures estivales fraiches et recevaient moins de précipitation sous forme de neige. Les caractéristiques linéaires à l'échelle du paysage influaient négativement la répartition des Nyctales de Tengmalm, mais les bordures créées par ces mêmes caractéristiques à l'échelle locale influaient positivement la répartition des Petites Nyctales.

The gut microbiome plays an important role in animal physiological and pathological processes, and has also been found to play a health protective role in the vulture adaptation to scavenging. However, the microbial taxonomic diversity (including nonculturable and culturable microbes), functions, and metabolites related to Himalayan Griffons have not been fully explored. In the present study, the 28 fecal samples of the Himalayan Griffons and 8 carrion samples were collected and sequenced using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods to analyze the composition and functional structures of the microbiomes. Twelve fecal samples of the Himalayan Griffons were analyzed using untargeted Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (LC–MS) to identify metabolites. We used different culture conditions to grow Himalayan Griffons gut microbes. Inhibitory effects of gut beneficial bacteria on 5 common pathogenic bacteria were also tested using the Oxford cup method. According to the results of the culture-independent method, a high abundance of four major phyla in Himalayan Griffons were identified, including Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. The most abundant genera were Fusobacterium, followed by Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Cetobacterium, Epulopiscium, and Bacteroides. The predicted primary functional categories of the Himalayan Griffons’ gut microbiome were associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, replication and repair, and membrane transport. LC–MS metabolomic analysis showed a total of 154 metabolites in all the fecal samples. Cultivation yielded 184 bacterial isolates with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, and Paeniclostridium sordellii as most common isolates. Moreover, 7 potential beneficial gut bacteria isolated showed certain inhibition to 5 common pathogenic bacteria. Our findings broaden and deepen the understanding of Himalayan Griffons’ gut microbiome, and highlighted the importance of gut microbiome-mediated adaptation to scavenging habits. In particular, our results highlighted the protective role of gut beneficial bacteria in the Himalayan Griffons against pathogenic bacteria that appear in rotten food resources.",https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40657-021-00287-0,avianres.biomedcentral.com,norte,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-11.4397688555589,['gyps himalayensis'],184

The interactive effects of climate and human socioeconomic factors on biodiversity in the Anthropocene may be studied most effectively from a social-ecological perspective. Climate can affect avian abundance, and socioeconomics may affect the human propensity to contribute to conservation. Yet, little is known about how these two factors interact to affect species. We assessed the relative influence of within-scale (landscape) and cross-scale (region-landscape) interaction effects of breeding-season temperature and four socioeconomic variables (percent female, percent college educated, median age, and median income) on the relative abundance of eight forest bird species in the Eastern Temperate Forest Ecoregion of North America. We used negative binomial regression to model relative abundance over three years. Akaike’s Information Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to rank a set of nine a priori models for each combination of species and socioeconomic variable. Of the 32 best-supported models, seven included informative within-scale interactions and three additional models included informative cross-scale interactions, indicating that the relationships between species’ relative abundance and socioeconomic variables varied for different levels of temperature. Our results suggest that interactions were generally less influential than were climate, socioeconomic, and habitat variables. Distinct responses to interactions were not evident between habitat groups or between wintering groups. Interactions between human socioeconomic variables and breeding-season temperature at different spatial scales can affect forest bird abundance in species-specific ways. Ignoring the effects of interactions on broad-scale patterns of avian abundance may result in misleading interpretations about additive effects and, consequently, ineffective use of limited conservation resources.
RÉSUMÉ
Les effets interactifs du climat et des facteurs socioéconomiques humains sur la biodiversité au cours de la période Anthropocène peuvent être étudiés particulièrement efficacement du point de vue socio-écologique. Le climat peut affecter l'abondance de la faune aviaire et les aspects socioéconomiques peuvent influer sur la propension humaine à contribuer à la conservation. Pourtant, on ne sait que peu de choses sur la manière dont ces deux facteurs interagissent pour affecter les espèces.

The interactive effects of climate and human socioeconomic factors on biodiversity in the Anthropocene may be studied most effectively from a social-ecological perspective. Climate can affect avian abundance, and socioeconomics may affect the human propensity to contribute to conservation. Yet, little is known about how these two factors interact to affect species. We assessed the relative influence of within-scale (landscape) and cross-scale (region-landscape) interaction effects of breeding-season temperature and four socioeconomic variables (percent female, percent college educated, median age, and median income) on the relative abundance of eight forest bird species in the Eastern Temperate Forest Ecoregion of North America. We used negative binomial regression to model relative abundance over three years. Akaike’s Information Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc) was used to rank a set of nine a priori models for each combination of species and socioeconomic variable. Of the 32 best-supported models, seven included informative within-scale interactions and three additional models included informative cross-scale interactions, indicating that the relationships between species’ relative abundance and socioeconomic variables varied for different levels of temperature. Our results suggest that interactions were generally less influential than were climate, socioeconomic, and habitat variables. Distinct responses to interactions were not evident between habitat groups or between wintering groups. Interactions between human socioeconomic variables and breeding-season temperature at different spatial scales can affect forest bird abundance in species-specific ways. Ignoring the effects of interactions on broad-scale patterns of avian abundance may result in misleading interpretations about additive effects and, consequently, ineffective use of limited conservation resources.
RÉSUMÉ
Les effets interactifs du climat et des facteurs socioéconomiques humains sur la biodiversité au cours de la période Anthropocène peuvent être étudiés particulièrement efficacement du point de vue socio-écologique. Le climat peut affecter l'abondance de la faune aviaire et les aspects socioéconomiques peuvent influer sur la propension humaine à contribuer à la conservation.

In this way, it was possible to redescribe Plasmodium huffi in detail, without the doubt characters observed in the original description.

The focus is on unworked and unburned cattle, pig, sheep/goat and red deer scapulae, phalanges (+ some astragali) and ribs—significant burial phenomena in the Únětice Culture—determined as undoubtedly intentional components of funerals, that is, as grave goods. Radiocarbon and other evidence show that the phenomena existed for the whole of the Únětice Culture and perhaps longer. The presence of scapulae in 41% of the graves in the cemetery at Mikulovice and tens of other cemeteries in Bohemia and Moravia, and the complete domination of phalanges among the animal bones in graves in the funerary area at Vliněves provide evidence of the importance of these customs in the funerary rite. Rib cuts certainly represent meat offerings but the meaning of isolated (unarticulated) scapulae and phalanges/astragali is difficult to determine. The hypothesis that scapulae found always singly could also be real meat offerings is difficult to accept, so further roles, whether practical or symbolic, should be considered. An earlier suggestion that scapulae were used as a trowel for digging grave pits is highly improbable, as follows from our analysis, and we were unable to confirm the use of the flat scapula as a plate for other offerings or a base for paintings. The choice of the (near-triangular) scapula to symbolise the triangle must be left in the realm of speculation. Unworked and variably positioned phalanges and astragali are unlikely to have been used for clothing or hair decoration but, based on analogies, might have been used in magic or games (amulets, tokens, dice, game pieces). The possible use of scapulae and phalanges + astragali in divination is considered in the light of ethnographic and historical records of scapulimancy and astragalomancy on four continents. As scapulae and phalanges do not usually appear together in a single grave, they could represent attributes of different social groups or statuses.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12520-019-01004-1.pdf,link.springer.com,piac-piac,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-11.4984891623737,,796

Detecting presence and inferring absence are both critical in species monitoring and management. False-negatives in any survey methodology can have significant consequences when conservation decisions are based on incomplete results. Marsh birds are notoriously difficult to detect, and current survey methods rely on traditional labor-intensive methods, and, more recently, passive acoustic monitoring. We investigated the efficiency of passive acoustic monitoring as a survey tool for the cryptic and poorly understood Eastern Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis) analyzing data from two sites collected at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, South Carolina, USA. We demonstrate two new techniques to automate the reviewing and analysis of long-duration acoustic monitoring data. First, we used long-duration false-color spectrograms to visualize the 20 days of recording and to confirm presence of Black Rail ""kickee-doo"" calls. Second, we used a machine learning model (Random Forest in regression mode) to automate the scanning of 480 consecutive hours of acoustic recording and to investigate spatial and temporal presence. Detection of the Black Rail call was confirmed in the long-duration false-color spectrogram and the call recognizer correctly predicted Black Rail in 91% of the first 316 top-ranked predictions at one site. From ten days of continuous acoustic recordings, Black Rail calls were detected on only four consecutive days. Long-duration false-color spectrograms were effective for detecting Black Rail calls because their tendency to vocalize over consecutive minutes leaves a visible trace in the spectrogram. The call recognizer performed effectively when the Black Rail call was the dominant acoustic activity in its frequency band. We demonstrate that combining false-color spectrograms with a machine-learned recognizer creates a more efficient monitoring tool than a stand-alone species-specific call recognizer, with particular utility for species whose vocalization patterns and occurrence are unpredictable or unknown.
RÉSUMÉ
La détection de la présence et l'inférence de l'absence sont toutes deux essentielles au suivi et à la gestion des espèces. Dans toute méthodologie de suivi, les faux négatifs peuvent avoir des conséquences importantes lorsque les décisions en matière de conservation reposent sur des résultats incomplets. Il est bien connu que les oiseaux de marais sont difficiles à détecter, et les méthodes de suivi actuelles sont fondées sur des méthodes traditionnelles plus laborieuses et, plus récemment, sur le suivi acoustique passif. Nous avons étudié l'efficacité du suivi acoustique passif comme outil de suivi pour le Râle noir de l'Est (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis), espèce cryptique et mal connue, en analysant les données provenant de deux sites au Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, en Caroline du Sud, aux États-Unis. Nous démontrons deux nouvelles techniques pour automatiser l'examen et l'analyse des données de suivi acoustique de longue durée. Tout d'abord, nous avons utilisé des spectrogrammes de longue durée en fausses couleurs pour visualiser les 20 jours d'enregistrement et confirmer la présence des cris ""kickee-doo"" du Râle noir. Ensuite, nous avons utilisé un modèle d'apprentissage automatique (Random Forest en mode régression) pour automatiser l'analyse de 480 heures consécutives d'enregistrement acoustique et examiner la présence spatiale et temporelle. La détection du cri du Râle noir a été confirmée dans le spectrogramme de longue durée en fausses couleurs et l'outil de reconnaissance du cri a correctement prédit le Râle noir dans 91 % des 316 prédictions les mieux classées à un site. Sur dix jours d'enregistrement acoustique continu, les cris du Râle noir n'ont été détectés que quatre jours consécutifs. Les spectrogrammes de longue durée en fausses couleurs ont été efficaces pour détecter les cris du Râle noir, car la tendance de cet oiseau à vocaliser pendant plusieurs minutes consécutives laisse une marque visible dans le spectrogramme. L'outil de reconnaissance des cris a été efficace lorsque le cri du Râle noir était l'activité acoustique dominante dans sa bande de fréquence. La combinaison de spectrogrammes en fausses couleurs et d'un outil de reconnaissance à apprentissage automatique constitue une méthode de suivi plus efficace qu'un outil autonome de reconnaissance de cris spécifiques à une espèce; cette combinaison est particulièrement utile pour les espèces dont les modèles de vocalisation et l'occurrence sont imprévisibles ou inconnus.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss1/art9/ACE-ECO-2021-1773.pdf,ace-eco.org,buckley,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-11.52403622925,"['laterallus jamaicensis', 'black rail', 'ou']",415

As breeding populations of many grassland bird species decline, assessments of breeding habitat selection and reproductive success can provide useful insight into breeding ecology to support conservation delivery. Here, we demonstrate the use of nest location and survival data collated from 20 data contributors across the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States and Canada over a half century to examine habitat selection and nest survival of Western Willets (Tringa semipalmata inornata) and Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa), hereafter “willets” and “godwits.” Both willets and godwits selected territories with less variation in vegetation height and topography relative to available locations. Willets selected nest sites that were flatter, closer to wetlands, and had shorter vegetation than Marbled Godwits, while godwits selected territories with greater wetland cover and shorter vegetation. Despite differences in fine-scale habitat selection, willets and godwits experienced similar daily nest survival rates and ecological drivers of nest survival. Nest success for the entire nest exposure period was estimated to be 0.521 (95% credible interval: 0.39-0.65) for willets and 0.562 (95% credible interval: 0.42-0.70) for godwits. Nest survival for both species increased with nest age and distance from the nest to the nearest wetland edge, while nest survival of godwits declined with conspecific breeding density. These relationships, as well as a weaker positive effect of microtine rodent abundance on nest survival, resembled drivers of upland nesting waterfowl reproductive success in the same region, which we attribute to their shared nest predators. Nest survival analyses of our collaborative dataset required substantial consideration of biases emerging from different data collection methods, ultimately reaffirming the importance of nest aging techniques in proper nest fate assignment. Analysis of compiled datasets using emerging analysis methods will continue to grow our understanding of the ecology of data sparse species.
RÉSUMÉ
Les populations de nombreuses espèces de prairie étant en baisse, l'examen de la sélection de l'habitat de nidification et du succès reproducteur peut apporter de nouvelles connaissances en matière d'écologie de nidification pouvant du coup contribuer à la conservation. Dans la présente étude, nous utilisons les données de localisation de nids et de survie récoltées dans la région des Cuvettes des Prairies aux États-Unis et au Canada sur une période de plus de 50 ans par 20 contributeurs, afin d'examiner la sélection d'habitat et la survie du nid chez les Chevaliers semipalmés de l'Ouest (Tringa semipalmata inornata) et les Barges marbrées (Limosa fedoa), ci-après nommés « chevaliers » et « barges ». Tant les chevaliers que les barges ont choisi des territoires qui présentaient moins de variabilité sur le plan de la hauteur de la végétation et celui de la topographie comparativement aux endroits disponibles. Les chevaliers ont établi leur nid à des endroits plus plats, davantage près de milieux humides et où la végétation était plus courte que les sites choisis par les barges, tandis que ces dernières ont sélectionné des territoires qui comportaient une superficie plus grande de milieux humides et de la végétation plus courte. Malgré des sélections d'habitat différentes à l'échelle fine, les chevaliers et les barges avaient des taux quotidiens de survie de nids et des facteurs écologiques clés de survie des nids similaires. Le succès des nids durant la période entière d'exposition de ceux-ci a été établi à 0,521 (intervalle de confiance [I.C.] à 95 % : 0,39-0,65) pour les chevaliers et à 0.562 (I.C. à 95 % : 0,42-0,70) pour les barges. La survie des nids a augmenté en fonction de leur âge et de la distance entre le nid et le bord du milieu humide le plus près chez les deux espèces, tandis que la survie des nids des barges a diminué avec la densité de conspécifiques nicheurs. Ces relations, de même que le faible effet positif de l'abondance de rongeurs de la sous-famille des microtinés sur la survie des nids, ressemblent aux facteurs liés au succès reproducteur de la sauvagine nichant sur les hautes terres de la même région, ce que nous expliquons par les prédateurs qu'ils partagent. L'analyse de survie des nids provenant de notre jeu de données issues de collaborations a demandé une attention très particulière quant aux biais inhérents aux différentes méthodes de récolte des données, nous permettant de réaffirmer l'importance des techniques d'attribution de l'âge des nids à la bonne classe de destin des nids.

The decline of aerial insectivorous birds has been hypothesized to stem, in part, from a decline in aerial arthropod prey, underscoring the need for long-term monitoring of both bird and arthropod populations. However, trapping arthropods can be time consuming and efficient methods are required. Our primary goal was to identify the optimal combination of insect traps to collect taxonomic orders of prey in the diet of a songbird in steep decline, the Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi). Our secondary goal was to sample the arthropod community as broadly as possible, and thereby monitor for general changes in arthropod assemblages, which may affect multiple species of migratory insectivores. In the boreal forest of central Alaska, we compared captures of canopy Malaise traps and three types of near-ground pollinator traps (blue vane traps, yellow vane traps, and chemically baited wasp traps) at 22 breeding territories where adult flycatchers actively foraged and bred. Combined, traps collected 11,193 specimens from 12 arthropod orders, of which moths (Lepidoptera, 36%), flies (Diptera, 34%), and wasps (Hymenoptera, 18%) were the most abundant, and also known components of flycatcher diets. General linear mixed models determined that canopy Malaise traps collected the greatest overall ordinal richness (11 orders) with a significantly greater abundance of specimens from six orders, two of which are aquatic specialists linked to breeding success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), another declining aerial insectivore. The three types of near-ground pollinator traps overlapped in taxa collected, but blue vane traps captured the most flies, bees, and yellowjackets, all of which were not well represented in Malaise samples. All trap types failed to collect dragonflies (Odonata), a known prey item of breeding Olive-sided Flycatchers. We therefore conclude that a combination of canopy Malaise traps and blue vane traps, plus hand-netting of dragonflies, is an efficient combination for quantifying prey abundance on Olive-sided Flycatcher territories, while simultaneously monitoring the broadest possible number of arthropod orders near flycatcher nests within the boreal forest.
RÉSUMÉ
On pense que la baisse des oiseaux insectivores aériens a peut-être découlé, en partie, d'une diminution des arthropodes aériens, soulignant le besoin d'avoir un suivi à long terme des populations d'oiseaux et d'arthropodes mis en place. Cependant, le piégeage des arthropodes peut prendre beaucoup de temps et des méthodes efficaces pour ce faire sont nécessaires. L'objectif principal de notre étude était de déterminer la combinaison optimale de pièges à insectes permettant de collecter les ordres taxonomiques de proies dans le régime alimentaire d'un passereau en forte baisse, le Moucherolle à côtés olive (Contopus cooperi). Notre objectif secondaire était d'échantillonner la communauté d'arthropodes aussi largement que possible, et ainsi de surveiller les changements généraux dans les assemblages d'arthropodes, qui peuvent affecter plusieurs espèces d'insectivores migrateurs. Dans la forêt boréale du centre de l'Alaska, nous avons comparé les captures de pièges Malaise posés dans la canopée et de trois types de pièges à pollinisateurs installés près du sol (piège à palette bleue, piège à palette jaune et piège à guêpe appâté chimiquement) sur 22 territoires de nidification où les moucherolles adultes s'alimentent et nichent activement. Ensemble, les divers pièges ont permis de collecter 11 193 spécimens appartenant à 12 ordres d'arthropodes; les papillons de nuit (Lepidoptera, 36 %), les mouches (Diptera, 34 %) et les guêpes (Hymenoptera, 18 %) étaient les arthropodes les plus abondants, et également des composantes connus du régime alimentaire des moucherolles. Des modèles linéaires généralisés à effets mixtes ont permis de déterminer que les pièges Malaise ont recueilli la plus grande richesse ordinale globale (11 ordres), capturant un nombre significativement plus grand de spécimens de six ordres, dont deux spécialistes aquatiques liés au succès de reproduction des Hirondelles bicolores (Tachycineta bicolor), un autre insectivore aérien en diminution. Les taxons collectés au moyen des trois types de pièges à pollinisateurs installés près du sol se chevauchaient, mais les pièges à palette bleue ont permis de capturer le plus de mouches, d'abeilles et de guêpes jaunes, tous peu récoltés avec les pièges Malaise. Aucun piège n'a permis de collecter des libellules (Odonata), une proie régulière des Moucherolles à côtés olive en nidification. Nous concluons donc qu'une combinaison de pièges Malaise et de pièges à palette bleue, ainsi que la capture de libellules au moyen de filets à main, est efficace pour quantifier l'abondance des proies sur les territoires de Moucherolles à côtés olive, tout en surveillant simultanément le plus d'ordres d'arthropodes possible près des nids de moucherolles dans la forêt boréale.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art1/ACE-ECO-2021-1849.pdf,ace-eco.org,forest-flycatcher,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-11.5674747970399,"['contopus cooperi', 'tachycineta bicolor']",293

General linear mixed models determined that canopy Malaise traps collected the greatest overall ordinal richness (11 orders) with a significantly greater abundance of specimens from six orders, two of which are aquatic specialists linked to breeding success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), another declining aerial insectivore. The three types of near-ground pollinator traps overlapped in taxa collected, but blue vane traps captured the most flies, bees, and yellowjackets, all of which were not well represented in Malaise samples. All trap types failed to collect dragonflies (Odonata), a known prey item of breeding Olive-sided Flycatchers. We therefore conclude that a combination of canopy Malaise traps and blue vane traps, plus hand-netting of dragonflies, is an efficient combination for quantifying prey abundance on Olive-sided Flycatcher territories, while simultaneously monitoring the broadest possible number of arthropod orders near flycatcher nests within the boreal forest.
RÉSUMÉ
On pense que la baisse des oiseaux insectivores aériens a peut-être découlé, en partie, d'une diminution des arthropodes aériens, soulignant le besoin d'avoir un suivi à long terme des populations d'oiseaux et d'arthropodes mis en place. Cependant, le piégeage des arthropodes peut prendre beaucoup de temps et des méthodes efficaces pour ce faire sont nécessaires. L'objectif principal de notre étude était de déterminer la combinaison optimale de pièges à insectes permettant de collecter les ordres taxonomiques de proies dans le régime alimentaire d'un passereau en forte baisse, le Moucherolle à côtés olive (Contopus cooperi). Notre objectif secondaire était d'échantillonner la communauté d'arthropodes aussi largement que possible, et ainsi de surveiller les changements généraux dans les assemblages d'arthropodes, qui peuvent affecter plusieurs espèces d'insectivores migrateurs. Dans la forêt boréale du centre de l'Alaska, nous avons comparé les captures de pièges Malaise posés dans la canopée et de trois types de pièges à pollinisateurs installés près du sol (piège à palette bleue, piège à palette jaune et piège à guêpe appâté chimiquement) sur 22 territoires de nidification où les moucherolles adultes s'alimentent et nichent activement. Ensemble, les divers pièges ont permis de collecter 11 193 spécimens appartenant à 12 ordres d'arthropodes; les papillons de nuit (Lepidoptera, 36 %), les mouches (Diptera, 34 %) et les guêpes (Hymenoptera, 18 %) étaient les arthropodes les plus abondants, et également des composantes connus du régime alimentaire des moucherolles. Des modèles linéaires généralisés à effets mixtes ont permis de déterminer que les pièges Malaise ont recueilli la plus grande richesse ordinale globale (11 ordres), capturant un nombre significativement plus grand de spécimens de six ordres, dont deux spécialistes aquatiques liés au succès de reproduction des Hirondelles bicolores (Tachycineta bicolor), un autre insectivore aérien en diminution. Les taxons collectés au moyen des trois types de pièges à pollinisateurs installés près du sol se chevauchaient, mais les pièges à palette bleue ont permis de capturer le plus de mouches, d'abeilles et de guêpes jaunes, tous peu récoltés avec les pièges Malaise. Aucun piège n'a permis de collecter des libellules (Odonata), une proie régulière des Moucherolles à côtés olive en nidification. Nous concluons donc qu'une combinaison de pièges Malaise et de pièges à palette bleue, ainsi que la capture de libellules au moyen de filets à main, est efficace pour quantifier l'abondance des proies sur les territoires de Moucherolles à côtés olive, tout en surveillant simultanément le plus d'ordres d'arthropodes possible près des nids de moucherolles dans la forêt boréale.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art1/ACE-ECO-2021-1849.pdf,ace-eco.org,olive,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-11.5674747970399,"['contopus cooperi', 'tachycineta bicolor']",293

Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase has previously been shown to be beneficial in in vitro and in vivo models of Huntington’s disease. Moreover, a recent cross-sectional study demonstrated that treatment with metformin, a well-known activator of this enzyme, is associated with better cognitive scores in patients with this disease. We performed a preclinical study using metformin to treat phenotypes of the zQ175 mouse model of Huntington disease. We evaluated behavior (motor and neuropsychiatric function) and molecular phenotypes (aggregation of mutant huntingtin, levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neuronal inflammation, etc.). We also used two models of polyglutamine toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans to further explore potential mechanisms of metformin action. Our results provide strong evidence that metformin alleviates motor and neuropsychiatric phenotypes in zQ175 mice. Moreover, metformin intake reduces the number of nuclear aggregates of mutant huntingtin in the striatum. The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is reduced in mutant animals, is partially restored in metformin-treated mice, and glial activation in mutant mice is reduced in metformin-treated animals. In addition, using worm models of polyglutamine toxicity, we demonstrate that metformin reduces polyglutamine aggregates and restores neuronal function through mechanisms involving AMP-activated protein kinase and lysosomal function. Our data indicate that metformin alleviates the progression of the disease and further supports AMP-activated protein kinase as a druggable target against Huntington’s disease. Metformin, an existing drug for diabetes, shows promise in alleviating symptoms of early Huntington’s disease in mouse models. Huntington’s disease is a genetic disorder that results in the gradual deterioration of motor skills and cognitive ability. It is caused by a defect in a single gene that then encodes a mutant huntingtin protein, which aggregates and kills brain cells. Growing observational evidence suggests that patients undergoing metformin treatment for diabetes type II exhibit fewer symptoms of age-related disease, as well as Huntington’s disease. Rafael Vázquez-Manrique at Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe, València and Pascual Sanz at IBV-CSIC and CIBERER, València, and scientists across Spain used metformin to treat motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a Huntington’s mouse model. They found that metformin alleviated symptoms by actively reducing huntingtin levels, dispersing aggregations and limiting brain inflammation.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-019-0264-9.pdf,nature.com,adelaida,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-11.5709289204997,,1050

Conservation efforts addressing the impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation on movements must rely on operational definitions of land-cover types that are relevant to the behavioral decisions made by the species of interest. Travel costs, and ultimately landscape resistance (or permeability to movement) can be assessed through experiments standardizing the motivation of individuals to move across specific landscape elements, including habitat patches, the matrix, and their edges. So far, most studies modeling landscape permeability based on cost values have focused on habitat-specialist species and characterized landscape composition based on contrasting, human-defined cover types such as forest and open land. We experimentally evaluated the permeability to movement of different forest-cover types for the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), a neotropical migratory species breeding in mature deciduous or mixed forest. We compared homing time and movement patterns of 60 radio-tracked males translocated over 500 m and released in untreated or partially harvested mature deciduous stands, as well as in conifer plantations, in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Although there was no strong effect of forest-cover type on homing time, path tortuosity, or travel speed, individuals released in conifer plantations tended to move faster and straighter than those released within untreated forest. Considering that translocated Ovenbirds have been shown to be less likely to return to capture sites in landscapes dominated by conifer plantations, our results suggest that they minimize time spent in inhospitable cover types. Responses to conifer plantation edges and similar interfaces may thus represent decisive components of time-based functional connectivity estimates. Hence, it appears that not all forest-cover types offer an equal resistance to Ovenbird movements and, consequently, a dichotomic habitat/non-habitat view may be too simplistic when assessing or modeling landscape permeability for passerine birds.
RÉSUMÉ
Les stratégies de conservation visant à réduire les impacts de la perte et de la fragmentation de l'habitat sur les mouvements doivent reposer sur des définitions opérationnelles des types de milieux qui sont pertinentes aux décisions prises par les individus des espèces focales. Les coûts de déplacement et, ultimement, la résistance du paysage (ou perméabilité au mouvement), peuvent être estimés par le biais d'expérimentations permettant de standardiser la motivation des individus à se déplacer à travers des composantes spécifiques du paysage, incluant les parcelles d'habitat, la matrice et leurs bordures. Jusqu'à maintenant, la plupart des études ayant modélisé la perméabilité du paysage à partir d'estimations de coûts se sont concentrées sur des espèces spécialistes en termes d'utilisation de l'habitat et ont caractérisé les paysages selon une perspective anthropique fondée sur des types de milieux contrastants, tels les forêts et les milieux ouverts. Nous avons évalué expérimentalement la perméabilité de différents types de couvert forestier aux mouvements de la Paruline couronnée (Seiurus aurocapilla), un migrateur néotropical qui niche dans les peuplements matures feuillus ou mixtes. Par des suivis télémétriques, nous avons comparé les temps de retour et les patrons de mouvement de 60 mâles déplacés sur 500 m et relâchés au sein de parcelles de forêt feuillue mature non-aménagée ou partiellement exploitée et de plantations de conifères dans le nord-ouest du Nouveau-Brunswick, au Canada. Malgré l'absence d'un effet important du type de couvert forestier sur le temps de retour, la tortuosité des trajets ou la vitesse de déplacement, les individus relâchés au sein des plantations de conifères avaient tendance à se déplacer plus rapidement et plus directement que lorsque relâchés au sein de peuplements forestiers non-aménagés. Puisqu'il a été montré que la Paruline couronnée est moins susceptible de revenir au site de capture lorsqu'elle doit traverser un paysage dominé par les plantations de conifères, nos résultats suggèrent qu'elles tentent de minimiser le temps passé au sein des types de couvert inhospitaliers. La réponse des individus aux bordures des plantations de conifères et aux autres interfaces similaires pourrait ainsi représenter une composante cruciale de l'estimation de la connectivité fonctionnelle. Il semblerait que les différents types de couvert forestier n'offrent pas tous une résistance égale aux mouvements de la Paruline couronnée. Il s'ensuit qu'une vision dichotomique habitat/non-habitat pourrait être trop simpliste pour l'évaluation ou la modélisation de la perméabilité des paysages aux mouvements des passereaux.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art6/ACE-ECO-2021-1831.pdf,ace-eco.org,ovenbird,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-11.7522925644738,"['seiurus aurocapilla', 'ovenbird', 'ou']",262

Animal behavior regularly has substantial effects on the outcomes of reintroduction efforts. Reintroduction involves capturing a subset of individuals from a source population and releasing them into novel environments where variation in retention rates, predation, and territory acquisition could affect the age-class structure, sex ratio, and genetic and phenotypic characteristics of restored populations. Exploratory behavior, quantified as the rate that individuals explore novel settings, is one such heritable trait that might be affected by translocation, especially given recent studies suggesting that exploratory behavior can predict the survival and retention of individuals in unfamiliar environments. To assess the potential effects that translocation may have on exploratory behavior, we compared exploratory behavior for three Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla) populations: (1) a population reintroduced to Everglades National Park in 1998; (2) a population close to the original source population, and (3) a distant control population in north Florida. Exploratory behavior was quantified by placing individuals (n=17 per population) in an exploratory chamber and comparing flights/hops, scanning events, thoroughness of exploration, and other movement behaviors. We found that individuals in the reintroduced population scanned less, conducted fewer flights/hops, and were more sedentary than individuals in the other populations. Our findings suggest a shift in the prevalence of personality types toward slow explorers has taken place in the 20 years since reintroduction, adding to other studies suggesting that slow explorers fare better in novel environments. Although the reintroduced population contained fewer fast-exploring individuals relative to the other populations studied, fast-explorer phenotypes may increase over time if they convey the fitness benefits described in other studies.
RÉSUMÉ
Le comportement animal influe souvent considérablement sur le résultat des efforts de réintroduction. La réintroduction implique la capture d'un sous-ensemble d'individus parmi une population source et leur libération dans de nouveaux environnements où la variation des taux de rétention, la prédation et l'acquisition de territoires pourraient affecter la structure des catégories d'âge, le ratio entre les sexes et les caractéristiques génétiques et phénotypiques des populations restaurées. Le comportement exploratoire, quantifié comme le rythme auquel les individus explorent les nouveaux environnements, est l'un de ces traits héréditaires qui peuvent être affectés par le déplacement, en particulier si l'on tient compte des études récentes suggérant que le comportement exploratoire peut prédire la survie et l'implantation des individus dans des environnements non familiers. Pour évaluer les effets potentiels du déplacement sur le comportement exploratoire, nous avons comparé cette dernière caractéristique chez trois populations de sitelles à tête brune (Sitta pusilla) : (1) une population réintroduite dans le parc national des Everglades en 1998 ; (2) une population proche de la population source originale ; et (3) une population témoin distante au nord de la Floride. Le comportement exploratoire a été quantifié en plaçant des individus (n=17 par population) dans une chambre exploratoire et en comparant les vols/sauts, les événements d'observation, la rigueur de l'exploration et les autres déplacements. Nous avons constaté que les individus des populations réintroduites observaient moins, réalisaient moins de vols/sauts et étaient plus sédentaires que les individus des autres populations. Nos résultats suggèrent un changement dans la prévalence des types de personnalité en faveur des explorateurs lents au cours des 20 années qui se sont écoulées depuis la réintroduction, ce qui vient s'ajouter aux autres études suggérant que les explorateurs lents obtiennent de meilleurs résultats dans les environnements nouveaux. Même si la population réintroduite comprenait moins d'individus explorateurs rapides que les autres populations étudiées, les phénotypes d'explorateurs rapides peuvent augmenter au fil du temps s'ils manifestent les avantages en termes de condition physique décrits dans d'autres études.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol17/iss1/art7/ACE-ECO-2021-2111.pdf,ace-eco.org,d'hinde,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-11.7529572891137,"['nuthatch', 'sitta pusilla']",50

The postfledging period of a passerine bird’s life is increasingly recognized as an understudied component of songbird conservation, because the habitat needs of fledglings can differ from nesting adults and survivorship during this period can substantially affect population growth rates. We studied postfledging survival of the Worthington’s Marsh Wren (Cistothorus palustris griseus), a state-listed salt marsh songbird subspecies in northeastern Florida, USA, during 2016-2017. Postfledging survival was low during the first 21 d following fledging for the cohort of tracked birds (0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.01, 0.37). The top a priori model indicated that heavier birds at the time of tagging exhibited greater survival than lighter birds, and birds from larger broods had greater survival than birds from smaller broods. Other covariates not in the top model that also influenced survival included the amount of tall-form smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) within the natal patch, which positively influenced survival, and the amount of black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) within the natal patch, which negatively affected survival. The low rates of postfledging survival combined with low rates of nest survival reported elsewhere indicate that Worthington’s Marsh Wrens in northeastern Florida require continued protection and warrant further research into management and restoration activities that will improve their habitat.
RÉSUMÉ
La période suivant l'envol du nid dans la vie d'un passereau est de plus en plus reconnue comme une composante sous-étudiée de la conservation des oiseaux chanteurs, parce que les besoins en matière d'habitat des jeunes suivant l'envol sont peut-être différents de ceux des adultes nicheurs et la survie durant cette période peut grandement affecter les taux de croissance des populations. Nous avons étudié la survie suivant l'envol du nid du Troglodyte des marais de Worthington (Cistothorus palustris griseus), une sous-espèce de passereau de marais salés désignée au niveau de l'État dans le nord-est de la Floride, États-Unis, en 2016 et 2017. Le taux de survie suivant l'envol du nid était faible durant les 21 jours suivant l'envol chez la cohorte d'oiseaux suivis (0,10; intervalle de confiance à 95 % : 0,01- 0,37). Le meilleur modèle a priori a indiqué que les oiseaux plus lourds au moment du marquage avaient une meilleure survie que les oiseaux plus légers, et les oiseaux provenant de couvées plus nombreuses avaient un meilleur taux de survie que les oiseaux issus de couvées moins nombreuses. Les autres covariables ayant un effet sur la survie, mais non inclues dans le meilleur modèle a priori, comprenaient la quantité de spartine alterniflore (Spartina alterniflora) de forme haute dans la parcelle abritant le nid, qui avait un effet positif sur la survie, et la quantité de jonc (Juncus roemerianus) dans la parcelle abritant le nid, qui avait un effet négatif sur la survie. Le faible taux de survie des jeunes suivant leur envol, combiné aux faibles taux de survie des nids rapportés dans d'autres études, indiquent que les Troglodytes des marais de Worthington du nord-est de la Floride requièrent une protection continue et davantage de recherches sur les activités d'aménagement et de restauration qui amélioreraient leur habitat.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol14/iss2/art19/ACE-ECO-2019-1472.pdf,ace-eco.org,longbill,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-11.8217694888656,"['cistothorus palustris', 'marsh wren']",871

Abstract
Olfaction, as a semiotic modality, receives relatively less attention than other sensory modalities. However, chemiosemiosis and semiochemicals are fundamental components of zoosemiosis, occurring across animal taxonomic groups. Indeed, olfaction is thought to be one of the most ancient sensory modalities from an evolutionary perspective and significantly, even unicellular organisms, such as the bacterium Escherichia coli, utilize a form of chemiosemiosis when foraging for nutrients, as part of a process known as ‘chemotaxis’. Further, many taxonomic groups have evolved to produce dedicated ‘semiochemicals’ (often known as pheromones or allomones) which have the sole purpose of being diffused into the environment as a social signal. In this paper, I highlight the importance of Umwelt theory when studying animal communication, by reviewing the less conspicuous and intuitive chemiosemiotic modality, across animal taxa. I then go on to discuss chemiosemiosis within a linguistic framework and argue that complex pattern recognition underpins linguistic theory. Thus, I explore the concept that chemiosemiosis has features in common with language, when the factor of time, in the transmission and decoding of a signal, is taken into account. Moreover, I provide discursive evidence in support of a unified theory of sensory perception, based on structural and functional aspects of",https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/lf-2021-0003,sciendo.com,derby,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-11.8348073760757,,295

In this study, sequences of the near complete 18S (SSU) and 28S (LSU) from rDNA of 13 species of gryporhynchids (adult specimens) representing eight genera (Cyclustera, Dendrouterina, Glossocercus, Gryporhynchidae gen. sp., Neovalipora, Paradilepis, Parvitaenia, Valipora) and one species of metacestode from fish (Neovalipora) were generated. Additionally, sequences of metacestodes of the genera Amirthalingamia, Neogryporhynchus, Paradilepis, Parvitaenia and Valipora from Africa recently added to the GenBank database were analysed. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference of each (SSU and LSU) dataset. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that the family Gryporhynchidae is a well-supported monophyletic group within the Cyclophyllidea. The trees inferred with SSU and LSU datasets had similar topologies and suggested that the genera Glossocercus (two species sequenced) and Paradilepis (four spp.) are monophyletic.

Conservation agencies use viewing blinds at prairie grouse leks as an outreach tool to engage the public. However, in declining bird populations, disturbance at viewing blinds associated with observer arrivals and departures may exacerbate inconsistencies in lek attendance. We studied observer arrivals and departures at public viewing blinds placed at Sharp-tailed Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) lekking areas using trail cameras. We also conducted an experiment to simulate observers arriving late or leaving early from viewing blinds and compared Sharp-tailed Grouse attendance and return times at these treatment leks to the same leks when observers arrived in the dark and left late in the morning as a control. Observers at public blinds arrived later and left earlier than manager-recommended guidelines for utilizing blinds. In experiments, periods during which no birds were in attendance at leks were longer after observer arrivals later in the morning than at controls. However, the return times of returning birds were similar at leks disturbed early, late, and at controls, although fewer birds returned to leks disturbed later in the morning compared to those disturbed early. Return times after observer arrivals were longer than after raptor disturbance and after observer movements within the blind. We did not observe mating or male-female pairs leaving leks together during disturbance treatments but we did at similar times during control observations, despite almost half the time spent at controls. We suggest that disturbances early, when females are more likely to be in attendance, are more likely to disrupt mating than disturbances that occur later, despite fewer males returning to leks disturbed later in the morning. We suggest that managers consider the impacts of human disturbance at viewing blinds in declining populations and potential mating losses that might occur at leks with inconsistent attendance.
RÉSUMÉ
Les organismes de conservation utilisent les postes d'observation de leks de tétras des prairies comme outil de sensibilisation du public. Cependant, chez les populations d'oiseaux en baisse, le dérangement engendré par les arrivées et les départs d'observateurs aux postes d'observation peut exacerber l'irrégularité de la fréquentation des leks. Nous avons étudié les arrivées et les départs d'observateurs aux postes d'observation publics placés près de leks du Tétras à queue fine (Tympanuchus phasianellus) à l'aide de caméras. Nous avons également mené une expérience pour simuler l'arrivée tardive ou le départ précoce d'observateurs aux postes d'observation et avons comparé les temps de présence et de retour des Tétras à queue fine dans ces postes-traitements aux mêmes postes lorsque les observateurs arrivaient dans l'obscurité et partaient tard le matin comme témoin. Les observateurs aux postes publics sont arrivés plus tard et sont partis plus tôt que ce qui est recommandé par les gestionnaires. Pour les expériences, les périodes pendant lesquelles aucun oiseau n'était présent dans les leks étaient plus longues après l'arrivée des observateurs plus tard dans la matinée que pour les témoins. Toutefois, le temps de retour des oiseaux était similaire dans les leks ayant été dérangés tôt ou tard, et pour les témoins, bien que moins d'oiseaux soient revenus dans les leks ayant été dérangés plus tard dans la matinée que dans ceux ayant été dérangés tôt. Le temps de retour après l'arrivée d'observateurs était plus long qu'après un dérangement par des rapaces ou suite à des mouvements d'observateurs à l'intérieur d'un poste. Nous n'avons pas observé d'accouplement ou de paires mâle-femelle quittant ensemble les leks lors des traitements avec dérangement, mais nous en avons observé lors des observations-témoins, malgré que nous ayons passé près de la moitié du temps aux témoins. Nous croyons que le dérangement tôt le matin, lorsque les femelles sont plus sujettes d'être présentes, est plus susceptible de perturber l'accouplement que le dérangement qui survient plus tard, malgré le fait que moins de mâles retournent dans les leks ayant été dérangés plus tard dans la matinée. Les gestionnaires devraient prendre en compte les impacts du dérangement humain aux postes d'observation chez les populations en baisse et les occasions d'accouplement manquées qui pourraient advenir dans les leks dont la fréquentation est irrégulière.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art25/ACE-ECO-2021-1986.pdf,ace-eco.org,goshawk,2022-04-05,0,0,1,1,1,-11.8776949153176,"['tympanuchus phasianellus', 'ou']",170

Epigenetic regulation can be examined under three main headings and study methodologies for all three will be discussed: DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl (CH3) group to DNA, histone modifications is a covalent post-translational modification of histones and non-coding RNAs are a group of functional RNA molecules that is copied from DNA but not converted into proteins. Epigenetic changes are being increasingly studied in the pathogenesis of most diseases including autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases to shed light on the different phenotypes and disease courses. We have aimed to review the basic concepts in epigenetic studies and summarize the data for epigenetics in autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases. Recent Findings Recent studies have assessed DNA hypomethylation in interferon-regulated genes in autoimmune diseases and in inflammatory pathways in systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs). Abnormal histone acetylation and methylation have been shown to be important in autoimmune diseases which was proven via effective targeted treatment trials against these pathways in mice models. miRNAs have an important role in the pathogenesis, and also, they can be used as diagnostic biomarkers in SAIDs (i.e., FMF, Behcet’s disease) together with autoimmune diseases. Although the number of studies has increased over the years in parallel with the increase of interest in this field, we await further studies to improve the understanding and management of pediatric rheumatic diseases.

Ecosystem anthropization is a main driver of biodiversity loss, but not all species are equally susceptible. Understanding and preventing biodiversity loss is particularly important in rapidly changing and biodiversity-rich areas like the Neotropics and requires exploring the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic vulnerability drivers. Here, we test how multiple potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors explain vulnerability to extinction in neotropical birds to provide a first insight into what makes these species susceptible to extinction and how they are responding to anthropization. Our analyses included data for 2268 neotropical birds. We characterized extinction risk based on the IUCN Red List categorization and tested the predictive value of seven intrinsic and four extrinsic variables using Bayesian MCMC Phylogenetic Generalized Least-Squares (PGLS) models. As hypothesized, we found higher intrinsic vulnerability to extinction among bigger and more specialized species which have low reproductive output and occupy smaller distribution ranges. Extrinsic drivers were also relevant predictors with more threatened species overlapping largely areas with fewer human activities (lower night light levels and lower human population densities). Our results show that the extinction risk of neotropical birds is correlated with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic vulnerabilities were as expected associated with narrower, specialized niches and slower life histories. However, risk was not higher in more humanized environments, but instead more at-risk species were found in less disturbed areas that we suggest may represent refuges for birds that previously occurred in wider ranges and have now been excluded from the more anthropized regions. Our results contribute to our understanding of vulnerability predictors in birds and provide a first evaluation of neotropical birds that highlights the complex relationship between human pressure and biodiversity loss.
RÉSUMÉ
L'anthropisation de l'écosystème est un pilote majeur de la perte de la biodiversité, mais toutes les espèces n'y sont pas autant susceptibles. Il est particulièrement important de comprendre et de prévenir la perte de la biodiversité dans des zones en transformation rapide et riches en biodiversité comme les régions néotropicales. Il faut pour cela explorer le rôle des pilotes intrinsèques et extrinsèques de la vulnérabilité. Nous testons ici la manière dont de multiples facteurs intrinsèques et extrinsèques potentiels explique la vulnérabilité à l'extinction des oiseaux néotropicaux pour fournir un premier aperçu des raisons pour lesquelles ces espèces sont menacées d'extinction et de leur réaction à l'anthropisation. Nos analyses incluaient des données portant sur 2 268 oiseaux néotropicaux. Nous avons caractérisé le risque d'extinction en fonction du classement sur la liste rouge de l'UICN et testé la valeur prédictive de sept variables intrinsèques et de quatre variables extrinsèques en utilisant des modèles MCMC bayésiens de Régression phylogénétique des moindres carrés généralisés (PGLS). Selon les hypothèses utilisées, nous avons constaté une vulnérabilité intrinsèque supérieure à l'extinction parmi les espèces plus grandes et plus spécialisées dont le rendement reproductif est faible et qui occupent des territoires de répartition moins étendus. Les pilotes extrinsèques étaient également des indicateurs pertinents, puisque davantage d'espèces menacées occupent des zones de moindre activité humaine (aux niveaux de luminosité nocturne faibles et à la densité de population humaine réduite). Nos résultats indiquent que le risque d'extinction des oiseaux néotropicaux est corrélé à la fois à des facteurs intrinsèques et extrinsèques. Les vulnérabilités étaient comme prévu associées à des niches plus étroites et spécialisées et à des cycles biologiques plus lents. Toutefois, le risque n'était pas plus élevé dans les environnements plus humanisés, mais davantage d'espèces à risque étaient présentes dans des zones moins perturbées, qui selon nous, pourraient représenter des refuges pour des oiseaux qui occupaient auparavant des territoires plus étendus, mais qui ont maintenant été exclus des régions les plus anthropisées. Nos résultats contribuent à notre compréhension des indicateurs de vulnérabilité des oiseaux et fournissent une première évaluation des oiseaux néotropicaux qui met en évidence la relation complexe entre la pression humaine et la perte de biodiversité.",http://www.ace-eco.org/vol16/iss2/art18/ACE-ECO-2021-1948.pdf,ace-eco.org,perijá,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-11.9799183112194,,170

In the Rolling Plains Ecoregion of Texas, the eyeworm (Oxyspirura petrowi) and caecal worm (Aulonocephalus pennula) helminths are found to be highly prevalent in bobwhite. While there have been increasing studies on the prevalence, pathology, and phylogeny of the eyeworm and caecal worm, there is still a need to investigate the bobwhite immune response to infection. This study utilizes previously sequenced bobwhite cytokines and toll-like receptors to develop and optimize qPCR primers and measure gene expression in bobwhite intramuscularly challenged with eyeworm and caecal worm glycoproteins. For the challenge experiments, separate treatments of eyeworm and caecal worm glycoproteins were administered to bobwhite on day 1 and day 21. Measurements of primary and secondary immune responses were taken at day 7 and day 28, respectively. Using the successfully optimized qPCR primers for TLR7, IL1β, IL6, IFNα, IFNγ, IL10, and β-actin, the gene expression analysis from the challenge experiments revealed that there was a measurable immune reaction in bobwhite in response to the intramuscular challenge of eyeworm and caecal worm glycoproteins.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00436-019-06418-3.pdf,link.springer.com,bobwhite,2022-04-13,0,0,1,1,1,-11.9824867611035,"['colinus virginianus', 'bobwhite', 'northern bobwhite']",979

Although its phylogenetic position is very important, several aspects of its postcranial anatomy remain unclear or unstudied. Here, we present a detailed description of the postcranial elements referred to Brasilodon, including previously mentioned specimens and new ones, which add relevant information about its postcranial morphology and provide a new insight into the anatomical transition between advanced non-mammaliaform cynodonts and early mammaliaforms. Functional and ecological implications are also investigated, based on the postcranial morphology and muscular reconstructions. The postcranium of Brasilodon differs from most non-mammaliaform cynodonts and presents similarities with tritylodontids, early mammaliaforms and extant therians, such as a ventrally oriented scapular glenoid facet, a distinct and ossified greater humeral tubercle, lack of ectepicondylar foramen, olecranon process, hemispherical humeral and femoral heads and a prominent intertrochanteric crest. The humeral torsion, the length of the deltopectoral crest, the large bicipital groove and the well-developed lesser tubercle, indicate that the forelimb of Brasilodon was hold in a semi-sprawling position, with well-developed adductor muscles to maintain the body off the ground. The short femoral neck and the strong medial projection of the femoral head indicate the femur was held in a more erect posture than in basal non-mammaliaform cynodonts. The anterodorsally projected iliac blade with reduced postacetabular process, reduction of the anterior part of the pubis, medially located lesser trochanter indicate a basically mammalian pattern of pelvic musculature, able to swing the femur in a nearly parasagittal plane.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216672&type=printable,journals.plos.org,guignard,2022-04-08,0,0,1,1,1,-12.0466396969325,,1076

Together, they constitute the clade Lepidosauria. Fully terrestrial vertebrates (amniotes) form their skin barrier to the environment under the control of a gene cluster, termed the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). Here we identified EDC genes in the genome of the tuatara and compared them to those of other amniotes. The organization of the EDC and proteins encoded by EDC genes are most similar in the tuatara and squamates. A subcluster of lepidosaurian EDC genes encodes corneous beta-proteins (CBPs) of which three different types are conserved in the tuatara. Small proline-rich proteins have undergone independent expansions in the tuatara and some, but not all subgroups of squamates. Two genes encoding S100 filaggrin-type proteins (SFTPs) are expressed during embryonic skin development of the tuatara whereas SFTP numbers vary between 1 and 3 in squamates.

We predicted that sage-grouse abundance would align most closely with the breeding abundance of other sagebrush-obligate birds. We used two different indices of sage-grouse abundance for comparisons: field-collected counts of fecal pellets (primarily indexing abundance in the nonbreeding season) and a spatially explicit index of breeding population size. Neither index of sage-grouse abundance was consistently predictive of co-occurring songbird abundance, with one species more abundant (Horned Lark [Eremophila alpestris]) and one species less abundant (Vesper Sparrow [Pooecetes gramineus]) where sage-grouse pellet counts were higher, and no relationship evident between songbird abundance and the spatially explicit sage-grouse population index.

To identify residues responsible for differential TRPV1 capsaicin sensitivity among species, we used intracellular Ca2+ imaging to characterize chimeras composed of capsaicin-sensitive rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) and capsaicin-insensitive chicken TRPV1 (cTRPV1) exposed to a series of capsaicinoids. We found that chimeras containing rat E570-V686 swapped into chicken receptors displayed capsaicin sensitivity, and that simply changing the alanine at position 578 in the S4-S5 helix of the chicken receptor to a glutamic acid was sufficient to endow it with capsaicin sensitivity in the micromolar range. Moreover, introduction of lysine, glutamine or proline at residue A578 also elicited capsaicin sensitivity in cTRPV1. Similarly, replacing corresponding rTRPV1 residue E570 with lysine or glutamine retained capsaicin sensitivity. The hydrophilic capsaicin analog Cap-EA activated a cTRPV1-A578E mutant, suggesting that A578 may participate in vanilloid binding. The hydrophilic vanilloid agonist zingerone did not activate any A578 mutants with capsaicin sensitivity, suggesting that the vanilloid group alone is not sufficient for receptor activation. Our study demonstrates that a subtle modification of TRPV1 in different species globally alters capsaicin responses.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64584-2.pdf,nature.com,curvirostre,2022-04-09,0,0,1,1,1,-12.3628251855052,,705

We show that clCRY2a mRNA is expressed in all retinal layers and clCRY2b is enriched in the inner and outer nuclear layer. To define the localisation and interaction network of clCRY2 we generated and validated a monoclonal antibody that detects both clCRY2 isoforms. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that clCRY2a/b is present in all retinal layers and is enriched in the outer limiting membrane and outer plexiform layer. Proteomic analysis showed clCRY2a/b interacts with typical circadian molecules (PER2, CLOCK, ARTNL), cell junction proteins (CTNNA1, CTNNA2) and components associated with the microtubule motor dynein (DYNC1LI2, DCTN1, DCTN2, DCTN3) within the retina.

The kinetic proofreading model can explain T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligand discrimination; however, the rate-limiting steps have not been identified. Here, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell adapter protein LAT at position Y132 is a critical kinetic bottleneck for ligand discrimination. LAT phosphorylation at Y132, mediated by the kinase ZAP-70, leads to the recruitment and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), an important effector molecule for T cell activation. The slow phosphorylation of Y132, relative to other phosphosites on LAT, is governed by a preceding glycine residue (G131) but can be accelerated by substituting this glycine with aspartate or glutamate. Acceleration of Y132 phosphorylation increases the speed and magnitude of PLC-γ1 activation and enhances T cell sensitivity to weaker stimuli, including weak agonists and self-peptides. These observations suggest that the slow phosphorylation of Y132 acts as a proofreading step to facilitate T cell ligand discrimination. TCR ligation activates the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 to phosphorylate the adapter LAT, which then coordinates TCR proximal signaling cascades. Weiss and colleagues show LAT-Y132 is critical to TCR ligand discrimination, as its phosphorylation represents a rate-limiting step in T cell activation due to a conserved glycine residue at position 131.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-019-0502-2.pdf,nature.com,rowi,2022-04-11,0,0,1,1,1,-12.7875940193591,,919

The long literary chain of interpretive topoi—Circe the witch, the whore, the temptress—stretches from Apollonius, Virgil, Ovid, and Dio Chrysostom to Spenser, Calderón, Joyce, Margaret Atwood, and Madeline Miller. Her role as Odysseus’ benefactor, so unmistakable in Homer, is soon forgotten; to Virgil, she is above all dea saeva, (‘the savage goddess’, Aen. 7.19). One distinguishing feature of Circe and her reception is the focus on representation: the enchantment of Circe, as Greta Hawes puts it, is above all a study in allegory. From the moment Circe put a spell on Odysseus’ companions, transforming them into animals in Book 10 of the Odyssey, Circe has invited analogical reasoning, centered on what the transformation from one being into another represents. More often than not, this transformation is interpreted according to a dualist thinking about humans and animals: subjects are transformed from one being into another being, thus representing some moral or physical degradation. This article, by contrast, concentrates on Circe's island through the lens of becoming-animal, the concept developed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in the tenth plateau of A Thousand Plateaus, ‘1730: Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-Imperceptible…’.

Prehistoric mining for this metal has been identified in surface and underground workings in Parys Mine, Mynydd Parys, Anglesey, although almost all of the surface workings are now obscured by the extensive deep spoil from more recent mining in the industrial period. These copper-bearing ores are in bedded lodes, together with some intruded vein deposits. The Bronze Age workings have been exposed underground where they have been intersected by the early 19th century industrial workings on and above the 16 fathom and 20 fathom levels in the Parys Mine. Spoil exposures contain stone hammers (‘mauls’), wood fragments, and charcoal; samples of the latter have been radiocarbon dated with chronological modelling suggesting activity took place in the first half of the 2nd millennium cal bc. Although relatively limited in extent, these important prehistoric mining sites are among the earliest found in the UK. They have survived due to their protection from surface erosion and limited accessibility. RÉSUMÉ
    Extraction du cuivre à l‘âge du Bronze à Myndd Parys, Anglesey, Pays de galles, de David. A. Jenkins
    L’âge du Bronze en Grande Bretagne est un terme fréqemment utilisé pour inclure à la fois le premier usage du cuivre env. 2400 av J.-C. et ausi le bronze d’étain env. 2100 av. J.-C., qui necessitaient tous l’usage extensif du cuivre. L’extraction de ce métal à la préhistoire a été identifiée en surface et sous terre dans des ouvrages dans la mine de de Parys, Myndd Parys, Anglesey, bien que les travaux en surface sont maintenant obscurcis par des débris étendus et épais d’extraction plus récente à la période indusdtrielle. Ces minerais porteurs de cuivre sont enfouis dans dans des couches avec des dépôts de veines introduits. Les ouvrages de l’âge du Bronze ont été exposés sous terre là où ils ont croisé les ouvrages industriels du début du 19ième siècle au niveau de la 16ième et de la 20ième brasse dans la mine de Parys. Les rejets exposés contiennent des marteaux de pierre (massues), des fragments de bois et des charbons de bois; des échantillons de ces derniers ont étés datés au C14 avec un modèle chronologique suggérant que l’activité avait pris place dans la première moitié du deuxième millénaire av J.C. Bien que relativement limités en étendue ces importants sites miniers préhistoriques sont parmi les plus anciens trouvés au Royaume Uni. Ils ont survécu grâce à de leur protrection de l’érosion en surface et leur accès restreint. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG
    Kupferbergbau in der Bronzezeit in Mynydd Parys, Anglesey, Wales, von David A. Jenkins
    Die Bronzezeit in Großbritannien ist heute ein Begriff, der oft verwendet wird, um sowohl die erste Verwendung von Kupfer um 2400 v. Chr. Als auch die Zinnbronze ab ca. 2100 v. Chr. Einzuschließen, die jeweils die umfangreiche Verwendung von Kupfer erforderten. Der prähistorische Abbau dieses Metalls wurde in der Parys Mine, Mynydd Parys, Anglesey, in übertägigen und untertägigen Gruben nachgewiesen, obwohl fast alle der übertägigen Gruben heute durch den umfangreichen Abraum des jüngeren Bergbaus aus dem industriellen Zeitalter verdeckt sind. Die kupferhaltigen Erze befinden sich in Lagergängen, zusammen mit einigen eingebetteten Ganglagerstätten. Die bronzezeitlichen Abbaustätten wurden unter Tage dort freigelegt, wo sie von den industriellen Abbaustätten des frühen 19. Jahrhunderts auf und oberhalb der 16-Faden- und 20-Faden-Sohle in der Parys-Mine durchschnitten wurden. Die Abraumfunde enthalten Steinhämmer („Schlägel“), Holzfragmente und Holzkohle; Proben der letzteren wurden mit Radiokohlenstoff datiert, wobei die chronologische Modellierung darauf hindeutet, dass die Aktivität in der ersten Hälfte des zweiten Jahrtausends v. Chr. Stattfand. Auch wenn die Ausdehnung relativ gering ist, gehören diese wichtigen prähistorischen Bergbaustätten zu den frühesten in Großbritannien gefundenen. Sie haben aufgrund ihres Schutzes vor Oberflächenerosion und ihrer begrenzten Zugänglichkeit überlebt. RESUMEN
    Minería del cobre en la Edad del Bronce en Mynydd Parys, Anglesey, Gales, por David A. Jenkins
    La Edad del Bronce en Gran Bretaña es un término que se emplea para incluir tanto el primer uso del cobre en torno al 2400 bc como el uso de las aleaciones de bronce y estaño a partir del 2100 bc, las cuales requieren una amplia utilización de cobre. La minería prehistórica de este metal se ha identificado en explotaciones superficiales y subterráneas en la mina de Parys, Mynydd Parys, Anglesey, aunque la mayor parte de los trabajos superficiales se encuentran en la actualidad ocultados por las extensivas y agresivas explotaciones mineras modernas durante el período industrial. Estos minerales que contienen cobre se encuentran en vetas estratificadas, junto con algunos depósitos de vetas intrusivas. Las extracciones adscritas a la Edad del Bronce se descubrieron en el subsuelo y fueron alteradas por las actividades industriales de principios del siglo XIX por encima de los niveles de 16 y 20 brazas en la mina de Parys. Las alteraciones producidas han permitido identificar mazas de piedra, fragmentos de madera y carbón; muestras de este último material han sido datadas por radiocarbono, y los modelos cronológicos sugieren que la actividad tuvo lugar en la primera mitad del II milenio cal bc. Aunque la extensión es relativamente limitada, estos importantes sitios mineros prehistóricos están entre los primeros documentados en Reino Unido. Estos restos se han conservado ya que estaban protegidos de la erosión superficial y con una limitada accesibilidad.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/0D5D16EE3A7153666945AEBAD5E6C672/S0079497X21000049a.pdf/div-class-title-copper-mining-in-the-bronze-age-at-mynydd-parys-anglesey-wales-div.pdf,cambridge.org,cuivré,2022-04-12,0,0,1,1,1,-15.371390202762,,140
